Tribunal summaries.


In a text message to the tenant, a landlord said “we don’t want to enter into a legal tenancy because of the toilet issue etc”, but “we will allow you to use the house in exchange for maintenance, at this stage and can we review it in 6 months say, ok?”.

The Tribunal said that there was a legal tenancy and that the Residential Tenancies Act applied. It found that the agreement was not clear enough to be a 6-month fixed-term tenancy, so it was deemed to be periodic.
Tenancy Tribunal Order 4270171






A tenant moved into a property. She felt she had made it clear to the landlord that she needed the property until at least Christmas, so believed she had a secure arrangement for this period. There was no written tenancy agreement.

Part way through this period the landlord gave the tenant 90 days’ notice terminating the tenancy. The landlord disagreed that the tenancy was for a fixed-term and said she understood that the tenant wanted the property for a short (but undefined) period and that she had no intention of entering into a fixed-term tenancy.

The Tribunal found that the tenant had not proven that the tenancy was for a fixed term. By consequence it was considered a periodic tenancy and the landlord’s 90-day notice ending the tenancy was valid.

In a Rotorua case, the Tenancy Tribunal found that two landlords intentionally tried to get around the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act by calling their tenants “flatmates”, even though neither of the landlords lived there. The Tribunal found that it was in fact a room-by-room tenancy, despite the fact that none of the tenants had been given a written tenancy agreement. The Tribunal awarded $2,170.44 against the landlords for various breaches of the Act.
Tenancy Tribunal Order 4203973



A landlord decided to rent her place to two groups of people (one couple, and another man). They had come to the flat viewing but didn’t know each other before this. They only signed one tenancy agreement, but the agreement divided the rent between each individual and said “Based on special individual rates, 3 rooms have beds provided.” The man’s behaviour became threatening, so the couple wanted to shift out.
The Tenancy Tribunal agreed with the couple that it was a room-by-room tenancy and they were only liable to pay their portion of the rent. The Tribunal also allowed the couple to exit their fixed term tenancy early. This did not impact on the other tenants because the Tribunal found that they all had separate tenancies.
Tenancy Tribunal order 4167394 4169182.




The tenant started her tenancy on a Wednesday, paying one week’s rent in advance for the rental week of a Wednesday to Tuesday. The landlord considered her rent to be due on a Thursday for payment through to the following Wednesday. Because the tenant’s weekly payment only took her through to the Tuesday of each week, the landlord’s computer system treated her as being in arrears. The tenant was harassed by the landlord with phone calls and text messages asking her to pay an extra day’s rent.

The Tenancy Tribunal decided that the landlord had breached the requirement that they not require the next rent payment before rent already paid expires, and that this was intentional because the rent record clearly showed the tenant was paying on a Wednesday for a Wednesday to Tuesday rental week. Because of this, and the way the tenant was harassed, they awarded exemplary damages of $340. This was at the low end of exemplary damages because it was not considered to be the usual behaviour of this landlord.

Tenancy Tribunal Order 4141577, see p5





The Tenancy Tribunal noted: “The term 'substantial' is not defined in the RTA. Some of the older Tribunal cases have suggested a 'rule of thumb' of 10% over market rent. In my view that is not a helpful guideline. Where rents increase at a rate above inflation, rent will eventually assume a greater proportion of household incomes. This will in turn reduce the availability of income for other household expenditure. In these circumstances, it is arguable that even a relatively modest increase over market rent could have a substantial effect.” 

J Smith Adjudicator, Tenancy Tribunal Order 4235532, at paragraph 23.




The landlord claimed the tenant owed $2,250 in rent. The landlord would collect the rent in cash and then spend it on groceries, rather than banking it, so there were no bank records. The landlord kept a rent book, but many entries had no dates next to them and were not signed.

The Tenancy Tribunal found that the landlord’s rent records were unreliable and that there was not adequate proof of rent arrears. They dismissed the landlord’s claim. The Tribunal also required the landlord to pay $200 in exemplary damages for failing to provide rent receipts. 

They said a landlord must keep proper business records showing all payments of rent and bond by the tenant. The Tribunal noted that proper business records are records that are orderly, to a high standard, completed when the payment is made, and that marks on a calendar or a scrap of paper are not good enough.

Nadia usually pays $300 a week in rent. She has recently lost her job and for the last two weeks she has missed her payment. The landlord has left a message on her phone asking for the money to be paid immediately.

Nadia wants to get on top of the rent payments but can’t afford to pay it all at once. Because she owns assets over the threshold, Nadia is not eligible for the Rent Arrears Assistance payment from Work and Income. She has now got some part time work and, after putting together a budget, she thinks she can manage repayments of $50 a week.

Nadia owes her landlord $600, which if repaid at $50 a week will take her 12 weeks to pay off ($600 / $50 = 12 weeks). So, for the next 12 weeks Nadia will need to pay $50 a week on top of keeping up with ongoing rent payments, ie, $350 per week for the next 12 weeks.





The tenants claimed the landlord was in breach of the requirements around vacant possession because the landlord had stored a considerable amount of their own belongings in the garden shed and in part of the garage. The garden shed was so full of the landlord’s belongings that the tenants could not use it.
 
The adjudicator agreed and said that “all of the landlord’s belongings must be removed from the premises unless they are a chattel provided as part of the tenancy and for the tenant’s use”. Even though the tenants had been provided an inventory list saying what items were in the property, it was not clear from the inventory list how much this would interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the property, and did not override their right to vacant possession of the property. The tenants were awarded $1,100 in damages as compensation.

The tenant signed a fixed-term tenancy agreement but when they went to the property, the landlord had left a significant amount of belongings in the garages and shed as well as rubbish and materials around the property. The Tribunal found that the tenant was entitled to not take possession. The lack of action by the landlord showed the tenant they didn’t intend to meet their contractual obligations, and meant that the tenant had the right to cancel the agreement.

A landlord in Northland lived in a portable cabin next to the rented house. The tenant told the Tenancy Tribunal that the landlord harassed her and her family. This included shouting at her visitors, posting bizarre messages on social media about her, banging on the windows early in the morning and shouting at the tenant and her children to get up, and turning off the electricity to the house. The landlord also installed an outdoor shower at the house, then would use it herself.
 
The Tribunal found that these actions were a serious breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment, and amounted to harassment. The Tribunal ordered the landlord to pay the tenant exemplary damages of $1,500 for the harassment.

Tenancy Tribunal Order 4158660 paras [22] - [27].





Tenants were found liable for damage done by their dogs urinating on the carpet of their rental property. The High Court said that because the dogs had already urinated on the carpet in the past, and the tenants would have known they would do this again because they roamed around freely inside the house.

Although the tenancy agreement expressly permitted dogs on the property, the Court said that did not mean the landlord assumed all risks of damage. The tenants had also told the landlord that the dogs were house-trained. The damage was deemed to be intentional.

Refer to Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.





Tenants were ordered to cover the cost of damage to the carpet and wall on the basis that this was intentional. During the tenancy the lounge carpet was heavily stained and had to be replaced and there was impact damage to a wall.

The Tenancy Tribunal found that “even if the act that initiated the staining to the carpet was accidental, the permanent staining was likely the result of the tenant’s failure to clean the carpet promptly after the incident which makes the cause of the staining intentional”.

A tenant rented a cottage in a rural area for 13 years. Over that time, the landlord never conducted a formal inspection, although they undertook some repairs when the tenant asked.

The cottage gradually got so rundown that there was extensive mould, rotting window joinery and weatherboards (causing draughts and damp, and allowing rats to get in), no insulation, blocked guttering and no filters to the house’s tank water system. The landlord also failed to install working smoke alarms.

Even though the tenant hadn’t complained during the tenancy, the Tribunal awarded her almost $11,000 by way of compensation and rent reduction for the landlord’s failure to maintain the house.

In Tenancy Tribunal Order 4212382, the adjudicator described how:

"Usually the party applying for the rehearing must show that something went wrong with the Tribunal’s procedure," and that

"A rehearing may also be granted where there is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the first hearing, if it could have affected the outcome."

"The District Court has held that if the Tribunal was simply wrong in its findings of fact, or its application of the law, this is not sufficient to establish a miscarriage of justice: a rehearing is not an alternative to an appeal."
