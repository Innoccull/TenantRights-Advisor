The Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) is the main law that sets out the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords. This law focuses on ensuring that rentals are secure and well maintained, that responsible tenants can enjoy them in peace, and that rent is paid. (For an overview of legislation that relates to tenancy issues, click here.)

It’s not uncommon, however, for misunderstandings and disputes to arise between landlords and tenants. It’s good for tenants to make sure they are equipped with good information about their rights and responsibilities so that they can try to resolve any issues as early as possible. In some cases, the tenant will be able to take action themselves, but in others they may need the support of an advocate. Most tenancy issues can be resolved without needing to talk to a lawyer. In fact, tenancy law dispute resolution is designed to solve disputes without the need for lawyers.

In addition to this website, there are a range of helpful resources available for tenants online, on the phone, and in person. Before signing up to a rental, it’s a good idea for tenants to read up on their rights and responsibilities. Some good online resources about being a tenant are:
The Tenancy Services website
The Renting and You booklet (available in a range of languages)
The Citizens Advice Bureau website
The Community Law Manual
Rentbot 

If a tenant can’t find an answer to their questions online or need in-person support, there are various free services available. As an advocate, you may also find it helpful to access these services. The organisations below are some of the key ones that can provide direct support to tenants and may help tenants to write letters to landlords, apply to the Tenancy Tribunal, and some will even accompany tenants to the Tenancy Tribunal or mediation. Tenants can seek help from:
Auckland Tenants Protection Association
Manawatū Tenants Union - Palmerston North
Tenants Protections Association - Christchurch
Citizens Advice Bureaux
