Landlord's Control and Discrimination:
Landlords can decide on rental criteria, but they cannot unlawfully discriminate against potential tenants.
They cannot instruct property agents to discriminate on their behalf.

Unlawful Grounds of Discrimination:
Discrimination on various grounds is prohibited under the Human Rights Act, including sex, marital status, religious beliefs, race, sexual orientation, employment status, family status, age, and disability.

Protection for Current Tenants:
Existing tenants are protected from unlawful discrimination, such as termination based on marital status or family status.

Tenant's Right to Assess Suitability:
Prospective tenants have the right to assess property suitability for their needs.
Landlords cannot predetermine unsuitability based on discriminatory factors.

Exceptions to Discrimination Rules:
Exceptions exist for renting to minors, considerations related to disability, choosing flatmates, and specific types of accommodation like retirement homes and school hostels.

Evidence and Complaints:
Without evidence, proving unlawful discrimination is challenging.
Complaints can be filed with the Human Rights Commission or the Tenancy Tribunal.

Penalties for Discrimination:
The Tenancy Tribunal can award exemplary damages up to $4000, and penalties under the Human Rights Act can be higher.

Lawful Reasons vs. Unlawful Discrimination:
Even if landlords have other lawful reasons for their actions, unlawful discrimination remains a violation.

Discrimination Based on Age:
Discrimination against a person aged 16 or 17 when considering tenancy is unlawful.

Tenancy Agreements for Minors:
Persons under 18 can sign tenancy agreements, but enforcement requires ratification by the Tenancy Tribunal.

Discrimination Based on Disability:
It is illegal for landlords to refuse rentals or treat tenants differently based on disability.
Landlords can refuse if special facilities are needed, but if reasonable accommodations are possible, refusal is not justified.

Mental Illness and Discrimination:
Refusing to rent to someone with a mental illness is clear grounds for unlawful discrimination.

Enforcement of Agreements for Minors:
Tenancy agreements signed by minors become legally enforceable on their 18th birthday, unless an application to the Tenancy Tribunal is made within ten working days.

Tick Box for Age in Tenancy Agreements:
The standard Tenancy Services residential tenancy agreement includes a tick box indicating whether the tenant is under 18.

Resources for Disabled Tenants:
Information on discrimination based on disability is available, and Tenancy Services provides a list of organizations assisting disabled individuals in finding rentals.
