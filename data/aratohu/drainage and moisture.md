Moisture in the home can be a large source of dampness and mould. This dampness can lead to poor health outcomes for tenants and can also cause the rental property to deteriorate more quickly.

The healthy homes moisture ingress and drainage standard means that landlords have to ensure that the rental property has adequate guttering, drainage and downpipes to take away water.

If there is an enclosed sub-floor (space under the floor), it will likely also need a ground moisture barrier (eg, a polythene sheet) to prevent moisture from the ground coming up into the house.

All private rentals must comply with all healthy homes standards, including the heating standard, within 120 days of any new or renewed tenancy on or after 1 July 2021, with all private rentals complying by 1 July 2025.

All boarding houses must comply by 1 July 2021. All houses rented by KƒÅinga Ora (formerly Housing New Zealand) and registered Community Housing Providers must comply by 1 July 2024.
