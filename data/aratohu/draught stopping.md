Under the healthy homes draught-stopping standard, landlords have to close up “unreasonable” holes and gaps that let in draughts, such as under doorways, through skylights and old floorboards. Draughts let cold air inside, making a home harder to heat.

All private rentals must comply with all healthy homes standards, including the heating standard, within 120 days of any new or renewed tenancy on or after 1 July 2021, with all private rentals complying by 1 July 2025.

All boarding houses must comply by 1 July 2021. All houses rented by Kāinga Ora (formerly Housing New Zealand) and registered Community Housing Providers must comply by 1 July 2024.

Landlords are not allowed to take into account the age and condition of the house when deciding whether a gap or hole is “unreasonable”.

This requirement includes blocking off old open fireplaces, unless the tenant requests in writing that it be left open so the fire can be used (regulations 25 - 26 Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019).

The Tenancy Services website has more information on the draught stopping standard.
