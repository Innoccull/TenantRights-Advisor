When a tenancy is ending there are a few simple things the tenant can do to help the tenancy end smoothly.
Quick tip

Even though the tenancy is ending, the tenant should make sure they keep a copy of all records associated with the tenancy, including the tenancy agreement, property inspection report, photos, rent records, etc. Keeping these can be really helpful if there is a dispute later.

If the tenancy is managed by a property manager, it’s important to make sure arrangements are clearly communicated with them. If the owner contacts the tenant to make end of tenancy arrangements, the tenant should immediately inform the property manager what was discussed.

If the property is being rented again the landlord will probably want to show new tenants through the property. In order to do that they must get the tenant’s permission. The tenant can not unreasonably withhold that permission, however the tenant can set conditions (s 48(3) RTA). For example, the tenant might want to limit access to a specific times and days.

When a tenancy ends the tenant needs to:
Move out by the end of the tenancy
Take all their property with them
Leave the property reasonably clean and tidy
Ensure they leave any furniture, etc, that the landlord provided
Return the keys to the landlord

(s 40(1)(e) RTA)

The tenant has to leave the property reasonably clean and tidy, but this does not mean in better condition than when they moved in. The landlord cannot require a tenant to pay for a commercial cleaner. The test of “reasonably clean and tidy condition” must take account of the state of the property when the tenant moved in, the length of the tenancy and allowance for “wear and tear”.

There is a checklist of the things a tenant should do or consider when moving.
The tenancy does not end until midnight on the date of the notice, so a landlord cannot require a tenant to move out by a specific time on that day. A landlord cannot arrange for new tenants to move in on the day the old tenants move out.

Ideally a final inspection should be done by the landlord and tenant together, but sometimes this does not happen. Regardless, the tenant should do a final inspection themselves and:
Compare their inspection with the initial property inspection when they moved in
Note any wear and tear
Take photos of each room

Quick tip
It can be useful for the tenant to have someone with them (a witness) when they do the end of tenancy inspection with the landlord.

There can sometimes be issues with the final rent payment, so it’s a good idea for the tenant to check with the landlord about what they think the final rent payment should be and double check that matches what they think it should be. The tenant should also cancel any services they pay for, eg, power, internet.

If the tenant pays for water it’s a good idea for them to take a meter reading on the final day of the tenancy.
Quick tip

If the tenant does not agree with the landlord’s assessment of the rent owing then the tenant should request a rent summary so they can check their records against the landlords.
