Introduction:
Family violence in a residential tenancy is unacceptable, and everyone has the right to live free from harm and abuse.

Tenant's Right to Withdraw:
Tenants experiencing family violence can give their landlord two days' notice of withdrawal from the tenancy without financial penalties.
Applies to both fixed-term and periodic tenancy agreements.

Requirements for Withdrawal Notice:
The notice must include the tenant's name, the tenancy address, and the effective withdrawal date.
Must be accompanied by qualifying evidence of family violence.

Approved Form for Withdrawal Notice:
The withdrawal notice must be on the Approved Form provided by Tenancy Services.

Delivery of Notice:
Notice and evidence can be delivered by post, email, or hand-delivered, even by someone on the withdrawing tenant's behalf.
Tenant should keep a copy of the withdrawal notice and evidence.

Qualifying Evidence of Family Violence:
Can include a statutory declaration, Protection Order first page copy, Police Safety Order copy, charging document copy, or a statutory declaration from a person specified to provide evidence.

Confidentiality of Information:
Landlords must treat the withdrawal notice and evidence as confidential; unlawful disclosure may result in a $3,000 fine.

Challenge by Landlord:
Landlords cannot challenge whether family violence occurred.
Improperly completed documents can be challenged in the Tenancy Tribunal.

Notice to Other Tenants:
If other tenants are on the agreement, the withdrawing tenant must inform them within two days, but no details about family violence need to be disclosed.

Effect on Tenancy Agreement:
If the withdrawing tenant is the only one on the agreement, the tenancy ends.
Remaining flatmates can negotiate with the landlord for a new agreement.

Rent Reduction for Remaining Tenants:
If other tenants remain, they are entitled to pay a reduced rent for two weeks, calculated based on a formula.
The formula: A = B รท C ร D.

Example of Rent Reduction Calculation:
Explains how to calculate the rent reduction for remaining tenants using the provided formula.

Options for Remaining Tenants:
Remaining tenants concerned about continuing the tenancy can consider applying to the Tenancy Tribunal due to unreasonable hardship.

Rent Adjustment Exemption:
The 14-day rent adjustment does not apply to tenants who pay income-related rent or are in a Public and Community Housing Management Act (PACHMA) tenancy.

Discussion with Landlord for Income-Related Rent:
Tenants with income-related rent or PACHMA tenancy should discuss changes in circumstances with their landlord.
