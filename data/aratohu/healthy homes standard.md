Exemptions from Standards:
Exemptions apply if the house is to be demolished, the tenant is the immediate former owner, or the flat is part of a larger building not owned by the landlord (e.g., an apartment).

Information in Tenancy Agreements:
New or renewed tenancy agreements from December 1, 2020, must include information on the rental property's compliance with healthy homes standards.
Detailed information on insulation, heating, ventilation, draught stopping, and moisture/drainage is required.

Compliance Statement Template:
Landlords typically use a healthy homes compliance statement template from Tenancy Services.
Non-template users must ensure they cover the necessary information outlined in regulations.

Tenant's Use of Compliance Statement:
Tenants in existing tenancies can use the compliance statement template to understand requirements and assess the need for improvements.

Practical Actions for Tenants:
Check for mould and dampness before signing a tenancy agreement.
Communicate promptly with the landlord about issues related to cold, moisture, or mould.
Consider rugs, carpets, curtains, and draught stoppers for better insulation.
Choose appropriate heating options, avoiding unflued gas heaters.
Air out the house regularly to reduce condensation and mould.
Ensure habitable rooms have openings to the outside.
Wipe away mould promptly using a solution of white vinegar and water.
