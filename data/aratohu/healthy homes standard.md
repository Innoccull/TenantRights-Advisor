A warm, dry house is really important for the health and wellbeing of tenants. Unfortunately however, many New Zealand homes are not in a good state.

The law is getting tougher on landlords who try and rent out cold and mouldy houses. From 1 July 2021 some rental properties will be required to meet the healthy homes standards, with all New Zealand rental properties having to meet the standards by 1 July 2025.

These standards set out the minimum requirements that landlords have to meet in terms of heating, insulation, ventilation, moisture and drainage, and draught stopping (see the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019).

There are different timeframes for meeting the healthy homes standards, depending on the type of rental property:

    Private rental properties must meet the standards within 120 days of any new or renewed tenancy that starts after 1 July 2021.
    All boarding houses must comply by 1 July 2021.
    All houses rented by Kāinga Ora (formerly Housing New Zealand) and registered Community Housing Providers must comply by 1 July 2024.
    All rental properties must comply by 1 July 2025.

There are three situations where landlords may not have to comply with the healthy homes standards or the timeframes:

    The house is going to be demolished or substantially rebuilt.
    The tenant is the immediate former owner of the rental property.
    The flat is part of a bigger building that the landlord doesn’t own (eg, an apartment).

There are also some specific exemptions that apply to particular standards. These generally relate to how reasonably practicable it is to carry out the work.

More about these exemptions can be found here.

From 1 December 2020, most new or renewed tenancy agreements need to include information about the rental property's current level of compliance with the healthy homes standards (s 13A(1CA) RTA). They have to provide detailed information about all five of the healthy homes standards (insulation, heating, ventilation, draught stopping, and moisture/drainage). Landlords who are required to provide this statement, but have not, can be fined.

Landlords will normally use this healthy homes compliance statement template from Tenancy Services. If they don't use the template, they must make sure they cover the necessary information that is set out in regulations 33 - 39 of the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019.

For a tenant in an existing tenancy, it may be helpful for them to work through the template themselves to get familiar with what's required and to make their own assessment of what's needed to make the tenancy a healthy home.
The tenant can use this tool to find out whether the landlord should be providing a healthy homes compliance statement.

In addition to being aware of the healthy homes standards and whether (or when) the landlord is complying with the standards, there are a number of practical things the tenant can do to make their home healthy.
Check the property for mould and dampness

Tenants should check that the house is free from dampness and mould before they sign up for a tenancy. Read more about how to find a good rental property here.

Tenants should also tell the landlord as soon as possible if there are problems with cold, moisture, or mould, and agree on when and how they will be resolved.
Consider rugs, carpet and curtains

If the floors are uncarpeted, the tenant may want to get rugs to put down, or ask the landlord to consider laying carpet. Thick curtains (eg, from a curtain bank) will also help keep the place warmer at night. Draught stoppers / door snakes are useful for gaps under internal doors.
Consider heating options

Some tenants will buy an extra heater for their bedroom and other living spaces. Consumer NZ has some helpful information on how to choose the best electric heater. It's best for tenants to avoid an unflued gas heater.
Air the house often

Mould tends to grow quickly when there is too much moisture in the air. Moisture can get into a house via steam from cooking and showering, condensation from drying clothes inside (and breathing!), and blocked gutters and poor drainage.

Airing out the house often is one of the ways to reduce condensation and mould. This involves opening the curtains and windows and letting air flow through the house. If windows can't be opened (eg, they have been painted shut), the tenant can ask the landlord to address this so they can be opened.

When cooking or showering, the tenant should open a window, or use an extractor fan. It's also a good idea to avoid drying clothes inside, if possible, except in a clothes dryer which vents to the outside. Dehumidifiers can also help to reduce the amount of moisture in the air.
The new healthy homes standards say that every habitable room must have a window, door or skylight that can be opened to the outside (reg 21, Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019).
Wipe away mould

Tenants should wipe away any mould or condensation as soon as they see any. A half-and-half mix of white vinegar and water is a good solution for killing mould.
