Under the healthy homes heating standard, landlords have to provide one or more fixed heaters in the main living room that can heat the room to at least 18˚C.

The main living room is the largest room that is used for general, everyday living, eg, the lounge or dining room.

All private rentals must comply with all healthy homes standards, including the heating standard, within 120 days of any new or renewed tenancy on or after 1 July 2021, with all private rentals complying by 1 July 2025.

All boarding houses must comply by 1 July 2021. All houses rented by Kāinga Ora (formerly Housing New Zealand) and registered Community Housing Providers must comply by 1 July 2024.

A heating assessment tool for landlords is available so they know what kind of heater they need to install for the particular space. This is something that tenants can check too to see if the heating that’s in their home is likely to comply.

Open fires and unflued gas heaters will not meet the standard. If the living space is very small, a fixed electric heater may meet the test, but for most houses a heat pump, flued gas heater or modern wood burner will be required.

The Healthy Homes heating standard provides more detailed information and guidance.
