Insulation stops warm air from moving through walls, floors and ceilings. It makes homes warmer in winter, and cooler in summer.

Ceiling and underfloor insulation has been compulsory in all rental properties since 1 July 2019. There are some exceptions, eg, if the floor space is too low to be accessible.

Landlords must give tenants an insulation statement with the tenancy agreement, which says whether there is insulation in the building and details of its location, type and condition (s 13A(1A) RTA).

Further details about the current insulation requirements, and the exceptions, can be found here.

The new healthy homes insulation standard will mean that some insulation that is already there will need to be topped up or replaced. The healthy homes insulation standard can be found here.
Quick tip

If a tenant thinks that the landlord hasnâ€™t been truthful about the amount of insulation in the property, they could ask an insulation company to come and do a check. Most companies will do this free of charge.
