Tenant is liable for intentional damage

If the tenant or their guests intentionally damage the property, the tenant is responsible. The landlord can ask the tenant to repair the damage, or to pay the cost of replacement or repair (s 49B(1)(a) RTA).
When is damage intentional?

While in many cases it will be very obvious that damage has been caused intentionally (eg, if the tenant kicks a hole in the wall), determining what is intentional damage can sometimes be difficult. There can be a fine line between situations where damage is accidental, careless, or intentional.

The High Court has said “Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the necessary steps to achieve that purpose. Damage is also intentional where a person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage is a certainty” (Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541 at [41]).

Tenant is liable for damage caused by criminal actions

If the tenant or their guests do something that is an imprisonable offence (eg, making meth) and this causes damage or destruction, the tenant is responsible for the repairs. It doesn’t matter if the damage wasn’t intentional (s 49B(1)(b) RTA).
