What is a periodic tenancy? 

A periodic tenancy is ongoing, with no end date. It keeps going until either the tenant or landlord gives the appropriate notice following the rules in the Residential Tenancies Act.

An example of a clause in a tenancy agreement that shows it’s a periodic tenancy is:

“This is a periodic tenancy and may be ended by either party giving notice as required under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. The tenancy will start on dd/mm/yyyy.”
The word “periodic” can be a bit confusing - it’s not something that gets used much in everyday talk. For something to be periodic, it means it recurs at regular intervals, or happens from time to time. In the case of a tenancy, the tenancy continues from one rent period to the next, with no end date. Other words that might be helpful for describing this kind of tenancy are indefinite, ongoing or rolling.
Advantages of a periodic tenancy

The tenant can give at least 28 days’ written notice to terminate the tenancy at any time if their circumstances change and they want to leave. They aren’t locked into paying rent for a fixed period (which is the case with fixed-term tenancies).

Landlords can no longer terminate a periodic tenancy simply by providing 90 days’ notice. They can only terminate periodic tenancies in limited situations. This provides assurance to tenants that they won’t be kicked out of their home without a good reason.
Quick tip
Advocates should generally encourage tenants to ask for a periodic tenancy, unless there are good reasons why a fixed-term tenancy is more appropriate for the tenant.
