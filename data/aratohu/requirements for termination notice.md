In order to end a tenancy, a tenant or landlord must give the appropriate notice.
What needs to be in a termination notice?

There is no required format for this notice, however all notices must:

    Be in writing
    Give the address of the tenant
    Give the date when the tenancy will end
    If issued by the landlord, set out the reasons for the termination
    Be signed by the person giving the notice

(s 51(3) RTA)

The date of the end of the tenancy does not have to relate to when the tenancy started or when rent is paid, as long as it complies with the required length of notice.
Errors in termination notice

If an error is made in either determining the notice period or in serving the termination notice, it is not necessary to start the notice period over again. The notice can instead be varied (either with the agreement of the other party) or with the consent of the Tenancy Tribunal (s 51(7) RTA).
Serving the termination notice

There are a variety of ways tenants can serve notice to a landlord. Tenancy Services provides a good explanation of the rules about serving notices.
