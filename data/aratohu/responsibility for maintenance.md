Landlord’s maintenance responsibilities

The law says that a landlord has to maintain their rental property in a reasonable state of repair. This doesn’t mean they have to keep the property in a perfect, modern condition. What is reasonable for the property depends on the age and character of the house, and how long it is likely to be lived in (s 45(1)(b) RTA). For details, see types of maintenance.
Tenant’s maintenance responsibilities

Unless stated otherwise in the tenancy agreement, tenants’ maintenance responsibilities include:
keeping the place reasonably clean and tidy,
weeding the garden and mowing lawns,
washing exterior windows,
replacing standard light bulbs, and
telling the landlord immediately when things need to be maintained or repaired.

What if the landlord won’t do maintenance?

Some landlords aren’t very good at keeping up regular maintenance on a property, particularly if the issues are just general wear and tear and there’s nothing that is obviously broken (eg, old carpet, or blocked guttering).

However, if a landlord fails to maintain the property, this is a breach of the tenancy agreement. Tenants have several options when a landlord is in breach. See more about remedying breaches here.
