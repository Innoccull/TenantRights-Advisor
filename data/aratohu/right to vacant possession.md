The property must be physically empty

A landlord must ensure the tenant has “vacant possession” of the house or flat when the tenancy begins (s 36 and 37 RTA). This means the tenant has the right to move into the property without the landlord, their family and friends or any other unwanted person being there.
Quick tip

If a former tenant or other person is still living in the property, it is the landlord’s responsibility to get rid of them — not the tenant’s.

“Vacant possession” also means that chattels (ie, furniture and items) that aren’t included in the tenancy agreement have been removed from the property. This includes things belonging to the landlord, or previous tenants, either in the house or in areas that are part of the tenancy (eg, shed, garage). If there are so many items left behind that the tenant can’t really move their own things in, this will be a breach of the rule on providing vacant possession.

If things have been left in the property, It’s important that the tenant doesn’t just dump or destroy belongings. They have to follow the same process as a landlord would regarding abandoned goods.

If there are facilities on the property that are to be shared among several tenants (eg, stairways, areas for drying laundry, driveways and common parking areas, rubbish disposal and storage areas), the tenant should not expect that they will get vacant possession of these (see s 2 RTA for a longer list of facilities).
