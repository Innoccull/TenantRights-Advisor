It’s good if tenants and their advocates are familiar with the basic rights and obligations of tenants and landlords. There is a better chance of a stress-free tenancy if landlords and tenants know what is expected of them!

A helpful resource is the Tenancy Services Renting and You booklet, which sets out tenants’ and landlords’ rights and responsibilities. The Residential Tenancies Act also lists the tenant’s main responsibilities and the landlord’s main responsibilities.
Quick tip
It’s important to remember that tenants' obligations are just as important as their rights. It will be difficult to ask for their rights to be respected if they haven’t fulfilled their obligations, eg, a tenant can tell the landlord that they need to do repairs, but they won’t be in a very strong position if they are behind in paying rent.

Following is an outline of some of the key rights and obligations of tenants and landlords. For details, see other topics within the Rights and Obligations section.
Key rights and obligations of the tenant

Tenants have the right to:

    Vacant possession (ie, an empty place) at the beginning of the tenancy.
    Quiet enjoyment (ie, reasonable peace, privacy and comfort) during the tenancy.

Tenants must:

    Pay rent on time.
    Keep the place reasonably clean and tidy and advise the landlord when repairs are needed.
    Pay for their own outgoings (eg, electricity, gas, internet and metered water).

Tenants must not:

    Stop paying rent, even if the landlord hasn’t done repairs.
    Intentionally damage the premises.
    Disturb the quiet enjoyment of the neighbours or the landlord’s other tenants.
    Make any alterations to the property without the landlord’s consent
    Breach any special conditions of the tenancy agreement, eg, “no pets”, or “no more than 6 occupants”.

Key rights and obligations of the landlord
