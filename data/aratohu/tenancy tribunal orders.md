Types of Orders:
The Tenancy Tribunal can issue various orders, including declarations, possession orders, monetary orders, and work orders.

Work Orders:
Work orders address physical or structural problems in the property.
Tenants should provide a comprehensive list of issues without specifying the date of discovery or estimated repair costs.
Evidence of notifying the landlord about the problem, usually through a 14-day notice, is crucial.

Request for Compensation:
Applied when the tenant faces costs or burdens due to the landlord's failure to meet obligations.
Compensation can cover labor, materials, power or medical costs, and the value of lost or damaged property.
Detailed breakdown of costs in the application is essential.

Exemplary Damages:
Fines for breaching obligations, acting as a deterrent.
Appropriate when there is a clear instance of an unlawful act.

Other Orders:
Declaration that a tenancy is covered under the Residential Tenancies Act.
Declaration that a notice to terminate the tenancy is unlawful.
Early release from a fixed-term tenancy.

Tribunal Orders:
Issued after a Tenancy Tribunal hearing, recording the decision made.
Various orders may be issued based on the dispute.

Timeframe for Orders:
Adjudicators rarely provide a timeframe; decisions may take at least a month or longer.

Returning to Mediation:
In some cases, the Tribunal may order the tenant and landlord to return to mediation.

Searching Tribunal Orders:
Tenancy Tribunal orders are generally available online for three years on the Ministry of Justice website.
Public can search for orders using names, property addresses, or application numbers.
