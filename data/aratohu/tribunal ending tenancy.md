There are various scenarios in which a landlord can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to end a tenancy, with provisions for tenants to oppose such applications. Key points include:
Ending Tenancy for Rent Arrears:
Landlords can apply for various reasons related to rent arrears, such as failure to remedy after a 14-day notice, being 21 days or more behind, or receiving three notices in 90 days with at least 5 working daysâ€™ arrears each time.
The Tribunal may decide on the notice period if the landlord is successful.

Breaches of Tenancy Agreement:
Landlords can apply to end a tenancy if there are repeated breaches of the tenancy agreement, such as smoking, having pets, or falling behind in rent.
A 14-day notice to remedy must be issued before applying to the Tribunal.

Ending Tenancy for Anti-Social Behavior:
Landlords can seek to end a periodic tenancy due to anti-social behavior occurring at least three times in a 90-day period.
Specific notice requirements include describing the behavior, providing dates, and advising the tenant of their right to challenge the notice.

Invalid Notices and Challenging at Tribunal:
If an anti-social notice is found invalid, landlords cannot reissue for the same event.
If challenged, landlords must provide evidence of the described anti-social behavior.

Domestic Violence Considerations:
If anti-social behavior includes domestic violence, the Tribunal may decide not to terminate the tenancy to protect the victim.

Ending Tenancy for Serious Offenses:
Landlords can apply to end the tenancy for serious reasons, such as causing damage or assaulting certain individuals.
The Tribunal may choose not to end the tenancy if the problem is remedied and unlikely to recur.

Ending Tenancy for Landlord Hardship:
Landlords can apply to end a tenancy if continuing it would cause significant hardship to the landlord.
The Tribunal considers the impact on both the landlord and the tenant.

Abandoned Tenancy:
Landlords can apply to end a tenancy if the tenant abandons the property and rent is in arrears.
The tenant remains liable for rent for a specified period.
