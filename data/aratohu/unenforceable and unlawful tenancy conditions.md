Landlords sometimes include clauses in tenancy agreements that may be inconsistent with the law, making them unenforceable. The Tenancy Tribunal treats these conditions seriously, and landlords may face consequences for enforcing them, including orders for exemplary damages.

Common Unenforceable Conditions and Reasons:
"This tenancy is not covered by the RTA":
The Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) applies to all residential tenancies, and landlords cannot exempt themselves by including such a clause.

"Property Manager has no direct liability":
Property managers, as legal agents, may still have personal responsibility for their actions despite agreement clauses stating otherwise.

"Landlord's decision in disputes is final":
Tenants have the right to seek legal remedies, and landlords cannot prevent them from accessing dispute resolution mechanisms.

"Restrictions on notice period for periodic tenancy termination":
Landlords cannot impose notice periods longer than the legal requirement for terminating periodic tenancies.

"Charging letting fees":
Letting fees were banned in December 2018.

"Rent increases without proper notice":
Rent increases must follow the legal process outlined in the RTA.

"Penalties for tenant actions (e.g., parties, noise complaints)":
Clauses imposing penalties or rent increases for tenant breaches are unenforceable.

"Charging fees for credit checks, lawnmower deposit, contents insurance":
Charging additional fees beyond rent and bond may be considered "key money" and is not lawful.

"Mandatory professional carpet cleaning":
Tenants are only required to leave the property in a reasonably clean and tidy condition; excessive cleaning demands are unenforceable.

"Smoking restrictions that are too broad":
Clauses restricting smoking outdoors impact a tenant's quiet enjoyment and are unenforceable. Restrictions on smoking indoors are valid.

"Excessive cleanliness rules (e.g., cleaning windows weekly)":
Landlords cannot impose overly strict or unreasonable cleanliness rules, affecting a tenant's quiet enjoyment.

"Inspection at any time":
The RTA specifies when and how often inspections can occur, and landlords cannot demand access at any time.

"Tenant responsible for all pest issues":
If the pest issue existed before the tenancy or is not caused by the tenant's actions, the landlord is likely responsible.

"Restrictions on visitors, parties, alcohol, noise after a certain time":
These clauses infringe on a tenant's right to quiet enjoyment, and landlords cannot insist on seeking permission for such activities.

"No overnight guests":
While landlords can limit permanent occupants, they cannot ban short-term guests, as it interferes with a tenant's quiet enjoyment.

"Immediate termination for noise complaints":
A tenancy cannot be terminated without proper notice, as per the rules outlined in the RTA.
