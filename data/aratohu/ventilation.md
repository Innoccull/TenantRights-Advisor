The healthy homes ventilation standard tells landlords what they must do so that their rental properties can be aired out (ventilated) easily. Problems with mould are often caused by damp air remaining inside a house.  Damp air is also harder to heat.

Rental homes must have windows that can open (and stay open) in the living room, dining room, kitchen and bedrooms.

Most kitchens and bathrooms will also need extractor fans.

All private rentals must comply with all healthy homes standards, including the heating standard, within 120 days of any new or renewed tenancy on or after 1 July 2021, with all private rentals complying by 1 July 2025.

All boarding houses must comply by 1 July 2021. All houses rented by KƒÅinga Ora (formerly Housing New Zealand) and registered Community Housing Providers must comply by 1 July 2024.

The tenancy services website has more detailed guidance on the ventilation standard.
