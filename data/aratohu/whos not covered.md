People who do not qualify as tenants are not covered by the protections provided in the Residential Tenancies Act. The RTA excludes various living arrangements, and some common exclusions are detailed below:

Boarders vs. Tenants:
If a person lives with the landlord or homeowner or their family, they are generally considered a boarder, not a tenant.
The property must principally serve as the homeowner or landlord's residence.

Flatmates and RTA Coverage:
The RTA covers landlords and tenants, not flatmates. A flatmate's rights depend on agreements made with tenants, typically outlined in a flat-sharing agreement.

Disputes Involving Flatmates:
Disputes among flatmates cannot be taken to the Tenancy Tribunal. Instead, they may be resolved through the Disputes Tribunal.

Transitional and Emergency Housing:
Transitional and emergency housing funded by a government department or under the Special Needs Grants Programme is not covered by the RTA, unless the parties opt in.

Holiday Homes and Temporary Accommodation:
Holiday homes let for a tenant's holiday purposes are not covered by the RTA.
Hotels and motels providing temporary or transient accommodation (usually less than 28 days) are exempt.

Empty Land Rentals and Caravan Living:
Renting empty land with a caravan not supplied by the landlord falls outside RTA coverage.
Rentals of cabins, caravans, or tents at a camping ground for less than 50 days may not be covered by the RTA, depending on the agreement.

Long-term Living in Caravan or Mobile Home:
Long-term living in someone else's caravan or mobile home on another person's land likely qualifies as a tenancy under the RTA.
Living in the landlord's caravan or mobile home while sharing their space may categorize the person as a boarder, not a tenant.

Other Exclusions from RTA:
Various arrangements and properties exempt from the RTA include commercial tenancies, hospitals, retirement villages, prisons, police cells, barracks, employee hostels, some tertiary student accommodation, temporary accommodation to club members, property purchase scenarios, lease-back arrangements, and more.

Note: Section 5(1) of the RTA provides a full list of living arrangements excluded from its coverage.
