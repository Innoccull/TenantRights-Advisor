What are some tips for avoiding flatmate problems?

Before you enter into any flatting situation, you should take the time to find out about the people you will be living with. You’ll want to be sure that you can get along with them and that you can rely on them to do their share of the household chores, pay their share of the rent and that they won't make you feel uncomfortable in your new home. Ideally, you and your flatmates should be able to discuss issues before become a problem, and agree on house rules. For example, you should try to agree on rules around:having friends or family visit and/or stay over;
sharing of housework duties, such as cooking, cleaning and grocery shopping;
sharing the use of items that are not communally owned;
It is well worth having a written flat-sharing agreement between all of the occupants at the start. This can help clarify what’s expected of each of you and can support your claim if there is a dispute later on. You will find a flat-sharing agreement template on the Tenancy Services website.  Print
