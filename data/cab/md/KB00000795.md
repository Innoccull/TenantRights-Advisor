The flatmate who held the tenancy has left and the landlord wants us out. Can we stay? What about our share of the bond?

If the flatmate who left was the only one whose name was on the tenancy agreement, then the remaining flatmates will also have to move out unless the landlord agrees to set up a new tenancy agreement with them.Bond will only be refunded to the person or people who signed the Bond Lodgement form (that is, those who signed the tenancy agreement). So if the rest of you are not named on the bond lodgement form, you must recover your share of the bond money from the flatmate who did sign the form.The tenant would have had to sign a Bond Refund form in order to get the bond money back. If they did not do this when they left, you can try tracking them down and asking them to do so. If the tenant disputes that they owe you a share of the bond money you can make a claim to the Disputes Tribunal. More information about getting bond money back is on the Aratohu Tenant Advocacy website.This information only applies to renting situations covered by the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA).
