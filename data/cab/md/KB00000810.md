My boarder is going away for a month. Can I charge him board during this time?

Private board is not covered by the Residential Tenancies Act.This means your boarderâ€™s rights and obligations as a renter, and your rights and obligations as the home owner, depend on what you have both agreed to.If you do not already have a written agreement, you can use the house-sharing agreement template on the Tenancy Services website.If your house-sharing agreement does not cover what the rent is when your boarder is away for a period, talk to them about it and try to agree on whether you can charge them for board and how much.When you reach an agreement, update the house-sharing agreement so you have a written record.If your boarder does not want anyone else to use their room while they are away, it is reasonable to charge them less rent during this time (because they will not use power, water, etc at your property while away).
