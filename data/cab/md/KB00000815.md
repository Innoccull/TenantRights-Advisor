What are my obligations as a flatmate?

That will depend on the agreement you’ve made with your flatmates, and whether or not you are a tenant. If you are a tenant you have obligations to your landlord / property manager.If you are a flatmate but not a tenant, then you will have obligations to your flatmate or flatmates who are tenants.These obligations are likely to include:that you will pay a share of the bond when you move in;
that you will pay your share of the rent and utility bills as required;
that you will give an agreed amount of notice if you want to leave the flat;
Ideally, your rights and obligations as a flatmate will be recorded in a written flat-sharing agreement. However, even if you do not have a written agreement, you still have any obligations that you’ve agreed to verbally eg, contributing towards shared flat expenses, giving reasonable notice before you leave the flat, etc.You can find a template for a flat or house-sharing agreement on the Tenancy Services website.You’ll find general advice for first-time flatters on the Tenancy Services website. Read more about your obligations if things go wrong at the flat.   Print
