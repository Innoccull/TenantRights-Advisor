What rights do I have as a flatmate?

It depends on whether you have signed the tenancy agreement. If you are named on the tenancy agreement then you are a tenant and have rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.If you are not a tenant then your rights are based largely on what you agreed to with the tenant flatmates when you joined the flat. If you signed a flat-sharing agreement this should set out your rights and obligations.It is always a good idea when moving into a new flat, to have a written flat-sharing agreement that covers issues such as payment of bond and rent, pets, housekeeping, and what to do when one of you wants to leave. Just as the tenancy agreement is a contract between tenant and landlord, a flat-sharing agreement is a contract between tenants and flatmates sharing a rental property.You can download a flat-sharing agreement template from the Tenancy website.       Print
