What does it mean if a building is yellow or red stickered?

After a natural disaster, red, yellow and white stickers identity how badly affected buildings have been affectedAfter a natural disaster (such as an earthquake or flood), your local council or Civil Defence officials can use red, yellow or white stickers to identify buildings as having been affected following a rapid building assessment.(A Rapid building assessment is a quick assessment to decide the usability of a building and associated infrastructure, after a hazard event such as flooding.)The colour of the sticker indicates what access you can have to the building.You must not remove or damage a yellow or red sticker, if you do this it is an offence under the Building Act and you could face penalties.A red sticker mean you cannot access the buildingA red sticker means no-one is allowed to enter the building, because of the high level of risk. This risk might be the building itself, but might also be from nearby buildings or unstable land.A yellow sticker means entry is restrictedA yellow sticker means that entry to the building is restricted, and cannot be used or that you cannot enter except under supervision for a limited time or on essential business. This could include emergency or assessment purposes, for example, or removing critical business records, valuables and property.A white sticker means you can enter the build but look out for damageA white sticker means that your building can be occupied. It does not mean that the building is not damaged. Be on the lookout for damage and contact your landlord or rental manager if you rent your home.Learn what your tenancy rights are after a natural disaster.Find out more about the red, yellow and white sticker system.Rapid assessment process and follow-up assessmentAn inspector will make an initial assessment – taking about 20 minutes – and can sometimes complete it from outside the building, without needing to enter.After the rapid assessment process, Civil Defence emergency management or council officials can direct the owner of a building to get a detailed assessment of the building. These assessments are the responsibility of a building owner.Find out more about the rapid assessment process, on the Building Performance website.Yellow stickers for earthquake-prone buildingsPrior to July 2017, the Wellington and Christchurch city councils used yellow stickers as a way of telling people that certain buildings were earthquake prone. These have since been replaced by a rating system. In practice, this means a building that has been assessed as meeting less than 34 percent of the building standard, would collapse and cause injury, death or damage to other property and must be strengthened.Learn more about yellow stickered earthquake-prone buildings, on the Building Performance websiteFind out about earthquake-prone buildings, if you are a building owner.
