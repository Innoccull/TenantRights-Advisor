The building I live in has been assessed as being earthquake prone – do I have the right to break my fixed term lease?

You can end your fixed term lease early if your landlord agrees to it. If your landlord does not agree to ending your fixed tenancy early, you can try applying to the Tenancy Tribunal to end the tenancy on the grounds that:an unforeseen change in circumstances is causing too much hardship for the tenancy to continue, or
the building has become un-tenant-able due to earthquake damage.
However, if the building is earthquake prone but has not suffered serious damage then it is probably tenant-able. See our information about ending a fixed term tenancy early.  Print
