What do I need to do when my tenancy ends?

Below are some things you need to do if you are preparing to move out of a rental property:Make sure you have given proper notice to your landlord, or that they have given you proper notice.
Check your rent is up to date.
Tell your utilities providers so they can work out your final bills, and pay those bills. If you leave unpaid bills it could affect your credit rating and references from your landlord.
Move out your possessions and clean the premises - you need to leave the premises in the same condition as when you moved in (except for fair wear and tear).
It is a good idea to take some photos of the rental property before the final inspection, in case there is a dispute about damage later on.
Arrange a joint final inspection with the landlord, and agree on when and how you give them the house keys.
Arrange with the landlord for the bond refund form to be completed and signed. It is a good idea to have a blank bond refund form with you at the final inspection, so they can complete it sooner. Do not sign the Bond Refund Form until you have agreed with how the bond will be refunded. Read more about this.
Give the landlord your forwarding address in case they need to contact you.
To ensure you receive all mail sent to you:
Ask NZ post for mail redirection.
Contact the people and organisations who normally send you mail, and tell them which address to send it to.
