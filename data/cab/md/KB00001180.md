What is the difference between periodic tenancy, fixed term tenancy, service tenancy and boarding house tenancy?

The type of tenancy you have will affect what your rights and obligations are as a tenant or landlord.A periodic tenancy is one that has no fixed date for the end of the tenancy. In this sort of tenancy the tenant can end it by giving notice, and the landlord can end it under certain conditions.
A fixed term tenancy has a start date and an end date, and runs for a set amount of time. Normally the tenancy cannot be ended before the end date.
If a fixed term tenancy is shorter than 90 days, it is known as a short fixed-term tenancy. The rules around short fixed term tenancies are different to those of longer fixed term tenancies. The Tenancy Services website has more information about this.A service tenancy is where an employer provides accommodation for an employee. Service tenancies have special rules relating to rent paid in advance and ending the tenancy.
A boarding house tenancy is where: 
the rental property is, or is intended to be, rented by at least 6 tenants, 
each tenant rents their own room in the property, and they share communal facilities (eg, kitchen, laundry) and
tenancies last for 28 days or more.
