A smoke alarm in our apartment building went off and the fire service turned up, but it turned out to be a false alarm. Are the fire service going to charge a call-out fee?

You will not be charged for a false-alarm call-out
No, you will not be charged a call-out fee. Fire and Emergency New Zealand stopped charging for false-alarm call-outs in July 2018.Â 
You could be prosecuted for giving a false alarm on purpose
If you give a false alarm on purpose, then you could face a fine and in some cases imprisonment.
