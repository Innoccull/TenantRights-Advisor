My tenant complained the stove was not working, but the electrical contractor checked the stove and found nothing wrong with it. Who is liable for paying the call-out fee? 

If your tenant claims an appliance (for example, the stove or heat pump) that is part of the rental is not working, it is a good idea for you (the landlord) to check the appliance yourself, before arranging for a tradesperson to inspect it. The problem might be that the tenant is unfamiliar with that particular model of appliance, which you could remedy yourself.If you arranged for a tradesperson and they did not find any faults with the appliance, whether you can pass on the cost of the call-out on to the tenant might be in the tenancy agreement.If the tenancy agreement does not cover this, talk to the tenant and try to come to an agreement. For example, if you could have avoided the call-out by first checking the appliance yourself, you might agree to absorb (not pass on to your tenant) some or all of the call-out fee.If you believe the tenant should pay but they disagree, you can issue themÂ a 14-day notice to pay this amount. Your tenant can challenge the notice by making a claim to the Tenancy Tribunal.Landlords are not responsible for their tenants' own appliances.  Print
