What can I do if I think the landlord is charging too much rent?

If you think you’re being overcharged, you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to have your rent reviewed. If you have a fixed-term tenancy you need to do this within 3 months of the tenancy starting or the rent being reviewed.If the Tribunal finds that your rent is substantially higher than the rents of similar properties in similar areas, it can order the landlord to drop your rent to market prices. You can check out the Tenancy Services website how much the market value of your property should be.More about this is on the Tenancy Services website.  Print
