Our rental was advertised as furnished – is the landlord responsible for the maintenance of those furnishings?

Any furnishings (eg, curtains, washing machine) that are included with the rental property should be specified on the tenancy agreement, and while the tenant is expected to look after those items, the landlord has an obligation repair or replace them if they have been damaged or are broken (but if the damage was done by the tenants, intentionally or as a result of carelessness then the tenant would have to pay for it).This includes wear and tear, so for example if the dishwasher is part of the rental and it stops working due to age then the landlord is obliged to fix it or replace it with one that works.If you and your landlord are unable to agree over who is responsible for the furnishings either party can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to resolve the dispute.
