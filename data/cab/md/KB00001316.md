I am a landlord. What do I need to do if I will be overseas for more than three weeks?

If you own a rental property in New Zealand and will be out of the country for more than 21 consecutive days, by law you must appoint an agent who can act on your behalf.This is so your tenant has someone to contact with any issues (for example, if the rental property needs repairs).You can appoint anyone to be your agent, but it should be someone you trust to look after your rental property and your tenants. You could engage a professional property manager or ask a friend or family member.Once you have appointed an agent, you need to:tell your tenants the name, contact details and address of the agent
fill out a change of landlord form for Tenancy Services
contact the Bond Centre and ask them to update their records with your agent’s name (so that if your tenant leaves while you are overseas they can get their bond back).
When you return to New Zealand you need to tell your tenant and Tenancy Services that you are back and taking over from your agent.If you do not appoint an agent, your tenants can give you a “notice to remedy”, which gives you a deadline to appoint an agent or provide the agent’s details.More information is on the Tenancy Services website.If you are moving overseas you should also tell Inland Revenue.
