The house I rent is for sale and the real estate agents keep bringing people through. Do I have to let them in?

If your landlord plans to sell the house you rent, they must tell you in writing.They must get your permission to show real estate agents (or other professionals such as valuers and building experts) or prospective buyers through the house.As the tenant, you can set conditions on their access into the house.For example, you can:specify which days and times the real estate agents and prospective buyers can visit
insist they can only visit by appointment
refuse permission to an open home or auction (when anyone can enter the property to look around).
You can also ask for a temporary rent decrease in return for allowing open homes, but the landlord does not have to give you this.More information about what your rights are if your landlord is planning on selling the property you rent is on the Tenancy ServicesÂ website.  Print
