Is going to the Tenancy Tribunal the only way to resolve a dispute between tenant and landlord?

No, there are other ways to try to resolve the dispute.Applying to the Tenancy Tribunal should be considered as the last step you take when other ways of solving the dispute – such as informal discussion and mediation - have failed. In fact if you apply to the Tenancy Tribunal it is likely that you will be asked to go to mediation, if you haven’t already done so, before the case is referred to the Tribunal.More information about the role of mediation and the Tenancy Tribunal in tenant / landlord disputes is on the Aratohu Tenant Advocacy website. The Tenancy Tribunal does not deal with disputes between flatmates, or disputes in private boarding situations (including where the renter shares the property with the owner or a member of the owner’s family)  - these are generally dealt with in the Disputes Tribunal. If you are not sure who can help with your renting-related dispute your local CAB can help you work it out.You can read about other ways of resolving tenant / landlord disputes and disputes between unit title owners and their body corporate.   Print
