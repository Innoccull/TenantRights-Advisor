How long does it take to get tenancy mediation or a Tenancy Tribunal hearing scheduled?

If a tenant or landlord has applied for mediation to resolve a tenancy dispute, the mediation will usually take place around eight working days from when they made their application.If a tenant or landlord has applied for a Tenancy Tribunal hearing to resolve a tenancy dispute, the hearing will usually take place around 20 working days from the date of application.It is useful to know that if a tenant or landlord applies to the Tenancy Tribunal without having first tried mediation, the Tribunal is likely to refer both parties to mediation – and a hearing will be scheduled if mediation fails to resolve the dispute.More information about the time frames is on the Tenancy Services website.
