A landlord I rented from in the past, claims I damaged their property when I lived there. What can I do?

If there was a problem with the rental property, the landlord should have told you about it when you were still living there or when your lease ended.When you left the tenancy, you and your landlord should have done a final property inspection together, to check if there is any damage you have to pay for out of the bond money. You usually have to do this before your landlord agrees to refunding your bond money. Read our information about what you need to do when your tenancy ends.If there is a possibility that you damaged the rental during your tenancy and that the damage was not picked up at the final property inspection, you could try to come to an agreement with your landlord about who is liable.If you and your landlord do not agree on whether you are liable, either party can apply for mediation, or start the disputes resolution process throughÂ the Tenancy Tribunal.
