If my landlord increases my rent, can they also ask for extra bond money?

This is not something that landlords necessarily do, however as long as the rent increase was lawful your landlord can ask for a “top-up” of bond money up to the equivalent of four weeks' rent. For example, let’s say that your rent was originally $400 per week and you paid a bond worth four weeks’ rent when you first moved in. If your rent is increased twelve months later to $450 per week, then your landlord is entitled to ask for a further $200 bond. This would bring the total amount of bond money you have paid for your tenancy to $1800, which equals four weeks’ rent at the new rent amount.  More about this is on the Tenancy website and the Aratohu Tenant Advocacy website.The above information only applies to renting situations covered by the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA). Some types of situations where the RTA does not apply to includes flatting, private board and when the landlord is living in the house.
