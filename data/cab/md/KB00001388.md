Can I transfer my bond to a new tenancy?

Yes, you can transfer the bond from your previous tenancy to a new one, if your previous and new landlords agree to it. The tenant and both old  and new landlords will have to sign a bond transfer form. The new landlord will then send the form to Tenancy Services.If the amount of the old bond is more than the new bond, the tenant is entitled to receive a refund for the excess amount. If the new bond is more, then the tenant must give the new landlord extra money to make up the difference. The new landlord must send it, along with the bond lodgement form, to Tenancy Services within 23 working days of the start date of the new tenancy.This is different from when there is a change of tenant during the tenancy, and the bond records needs to be updated remove the old tenant and add the new tenant.
