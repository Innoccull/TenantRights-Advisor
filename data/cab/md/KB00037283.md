Last time I inspected my rental the tenants threatened me with violence. Can I evict them for this?







Yes, you can.  If your tenants threaten you or your family, or cause (or threaten to cause) substantial damage to your property, you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal for a termination order to evict them.   Read more about terminating a tenancy when you are a landlord.
