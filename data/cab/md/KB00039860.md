I'm a flatmate and the head tenant won't agree to my boyfriend moving in with us. What can I do?  

In a flatting situation where one flatmate is named on the tenancy agreement and the others are not, it is only the former (often referred to as the "head tenant") who has a right to live on the property. (Read more about the difference between tenant and flatmate.)If you are not a tenant (your name is not on the tenancy agreement) then you don't have the right to bring in a new flatmate (or to remove a current flatmate), unless the head tenant agrees to it. So if you are not able to get the head tenant to agree to your boyfriend moving into the flat with you, your options include moving out of the flat and finding a new flat to live in with your boyfriend.Even if you are on the tenancy agreement, you still need to negotiate with any other people who are named on the tenancy agreement if you want someone new to move in - since the tenants of a property share the responsibilities and rights.Read about how disputes between flatmates or tenants can be resolved.
