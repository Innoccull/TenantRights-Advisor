Is it normal to pay bond for private board and what do I do if they won’t give it back when I leave?  

If you are a private boarder, you and your landlord are not covered by the Residential Tenancies Act .A landlord can ask you for bondThe conditions of your board, including whether you have to pay a bond, are whatever you and your landlord agreed to before you moved in.Your landlord should:give you a receipt for any bond you pay
tell you how you can get your bond back when you leave and
record this in a written house sharing agreement.
If you pay bond to your landlord, they do not have to pass it on to Tenancy Services. This requirement only applies to tenancies covered by the RTA.Protect yourself with a written house-sharing agreementIt is a good idea to record the conditions of your board in a house-sharing agreement, and to make sure that you and your landlord sign it. Tenancy Services has a template you can use.If there is a problem later, it will be easier to prove what you both agreed to.The Disputes Tribunal can help in a dispute over refunding your bondIf your landlord will not refund the bond when you leave, or you think they deducted too much from the bond, you can apply to the Disputes Tribunal to resolve it.
