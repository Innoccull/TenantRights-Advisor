What do I need to know about paying for a property manager to look after my rental property?

Property managers take on the tasks that landlords normally do, for example:finding tenants;
receiving rents;
doing regular property inspections;
dealing with maintenance and repairs on the property;
handling disputes with the tenants.
If you are a landlord, you might consider paying for a property manager’s services while you are out of the country, or because you do not have the time or skills to manage the property yourself.There are no qualifications that an individual must have in order to become a property manager, nor any specific professional courses that they must have completed. If you are looking for someone to manage a rental property that you own, it is important to ask them questions about their experience, how they will provide their service to you, and any relevant qualifications.The relationship between you and your property manager should be clearly defined in a written property management agreement. This agreement should include details like:what fee the property manager will charge (this is likely to be a percentage of the rent);
how often they will report to you;
the processes they will use to select tenants;
how they will deal with issues with the tenancy, including requests for repairs;
how often they will inspect the property;
how they will manage payments from tenants, as well as expenses;
how they will manage the end of the tenancy.
The property manager is likely to already have a template of this agreement, but it is a good idea to have your lawyer view it before you sign it.More information is on the Tenancy Services website.   Print
