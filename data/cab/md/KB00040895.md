As a tenant do I have the right to install fibre broadband at the place I am renting? 

If you ask your landlord to have fibre broadband installed at the property you are renting, your landlord must accept as long as there is currently no fibre connection at the property, it is possible to install fibre, and it can be installed at no cost to your landlord. (The latter usually means that the installation costs are covered by the Government under the Ultra-Fast Broadband programme).However, there are exceptions. Your landlord does not have to accept your request if:the installation will compromise the weathertightness, character or structural integrity of a building;
the installation will breach an obligation or restriction on the premises eg, a bylaw, planning or corporate rule, or covenant; or
the installation will get in the way of extensive renovations to the property, that the landlord is planning on starting within 90 days of receiving your request;
your landlord applies to the Tenancy Tribunal and the Tribunal determined that your landlord does not have to allow you to install fibre broadband on the premises.
You can suggest that your landlord speak to the installer, if they are concerned about possible damage to the property as a result of the installation.As the tenant you will be responsible for the on-going cost of using the fibre broadband connection.Unlike with minor changes to the property, at the end of your tenancy you do not have to remove the fibre connection.More information is on the Tenancy Services website, including a template tenants can use to make their request and another that landlords can make to respond to their tenant's request.
