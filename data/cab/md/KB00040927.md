What are my rights as a tenant if my landlord wants to do building work that might make the property un-liveable?

If your landlord is planning to arrange building work that might affect your enjoyment of the premises, they should decide (eg, by consulting with the building work provider) whether it would be safe for you to stay in the property while the work is underway.If it will not be safe for you to remain while the work is being done, your landlord should let you know how long it will be before the property is habitable again, and ask you to move out in the meantime. In this situation you do not have to pay rent over this period. Your landlord might agree to help find you alternative accommodation, for which you would be expected to pay rent.If it will be safe for you to remain while the building work is going on, you can negotiate with the landlord for some compensation â€“ for example, a reduced rent during this period.If you and your landlord are not able to come to an agreement, either party can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to resolve the matter.
