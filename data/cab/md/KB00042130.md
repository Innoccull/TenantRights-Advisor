What happens when our landlord does a property inspection?

At a property inspection, the landlord (or property manager) checks that:there is no damage to the property,
any appliances and furnishings that come with the rental are working
the tenants are keeping the property reasonably clean and tidy.
They can also test for methamphetamine. Learn more about your rights and obligations regarding the use or manufacture of methamphetamine in the rental.What tenants should do before a property inspectionIf you are a tenant, you can decide whether to be present for the inspection.You should tidy up the property and look for anything that needs fixing.Use this handy checklist of what landlords and property managers look for when doing a property inspection. Make notes of things that you need the landlord to do, for example repairs, or any issues you want to discuss.It is a good idea to have a copy of the property inspection you did with the landlord just before you moved in, so you can check what has changed.You do not have to do professional cleaning for a property inspection.Your landlord must respect your privacyYour landlord is entitled to take photos of rooms.
