What must I do if the building I own is deemed earthquake prone?

Under the Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016, councils must notify the owners of buildings that are potentially earthquake prone.Note that this only applies to:commercial buildings and
residential building of more than one storey, that either:
have three or more household units (for example, apartments) or
are used for accommodation (such as a hostel or boarding house).

You need to get a professional assessmentIf your council tells you your building might be earthquake prone, you must pay for an earthquake assessment from a qualified engineer. The engineer should follow the earthquake-prone building methodology (EPB) in their assessment (information about the EPB is on the Building Performance website).  If the building is assessed as earthquake prone, tell your councilThe council will then give you an earthquake prone building notice that you must display on the property, and give you a deadline to either strengthen or demolish the building. They will also add your building to the national register of earthquake prone buildings. More informationThe Building Performance website has more information for owners of earthquake prone buildings.
