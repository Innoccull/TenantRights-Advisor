We just separated – what happens to the tenancy of our home? 

When you separate you both need to agree on your living arrangements In general, if your relationship ends you and your partner can agree on things like:who will leave the home and who will stay
how you will divide your relationship property
how you will share the care of your children
These are your options if you are both tenantsIf you and your ex-partner are both named as tenants of the property, you need to agree on whether:you both continue to live in the rental property (learn about continuing to live together after you separate) or
one of you will leave (find out what you need to do in this situation)
As you are both tenants, one of you cannot make the other one leave without their agreement (except in the case of family violence).If you are in dispute over who should stay and who should go, either could apply to the Disputes Tribunal to settle it. Learn how to apply to the Disputes Tribunal.These are your options if only one of you is a tenantIf one of you is the sole tenant, then as the sole tenant you could:remain in the property, and the ex-partner leaves
end the tenancy and both of you leave the rental property or
end the tenancy and the ex-partner asks the landlord about starting a new tenancy at the property.
The sole tenant is legally entitled to remain on the property and can make the ex-partner leave the rental property.For example, the sole tenant could:give the ex-partner notice to leave the property
trespass the ex-partner from the property if they will not leave
Find out about trespass notices.If you are in dispute over who should stay and who should go, either could apply to the Disputes Tribunal to settle it.This does not apply if the non-tenant partner is a victim of family violence.The exception is if you are ending the relationship because of family violenceIf you are leaving the relationship to escape family violence and have applied for a protection order, you can also apply for a tenancy order.A tenancy order gives you the right to live in any place where you and the abusive partner have been renting together. It makes you the sole tenant of the property. Your partner stops being the tenant (if they were before the tenancy order) and no longer has the right to live there.The judge will only grant a tenancy order if they decide it is necessary to protect you (the applicant), or that it is in the best interests of you or your children.But the judge cannot grant a tenancy order if there are other people who are also tenants of the property.Learn more about tenancy orders, on the Tenancy Services website.Learn about protection orders.   Print
