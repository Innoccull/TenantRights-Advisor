My landlord gave 90 days’ notice to end the tenancy but we can move out sooner. Do we have to give the landlord 28 day’ notice? 

For a periodic tenancy, yes. Your landlord's notice ends the tenancy in 90 days. If you want to move out before the 90 days period ends, you need to give your landlord 28 days' notice  to end the tenancy sooner.More information about notice periods for a periodic tenancy is on the Tenancy Services website It is different for fixed term tenancies. For these it is difficult to end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless both landlord and tenant agree to it. Read more about this.   Print
