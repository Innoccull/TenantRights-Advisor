The landlord wouldn't rent to me because of who I am. What can I do?

As set out in both the Human Rights Act and the Residential Tenancies Act, it is illegal for a landlord to discriminate against you in relation to granting, continuing, extending, changing, ending or renewing a tenancy agreement. It is also illegal for them to advertise in a discriminatory way.If you feel you have been discriminated against you can contact the Human Rights Commission to get advice or complain. Alternatively, you can make an application to the Tenancy Tribunal (but you can't complain to both agencies).  Print
