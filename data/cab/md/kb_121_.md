Our landlord keeps popping over to do maintenance on the property, which we find a bit invasive. What are our rights?

As a tenant you have a right to the quiet enjoyment of the property. If your landlord is not allowing you to have quiet enjoyment, by visiting more frequently than is reasonable, try talking to your landlord and explain how you feel about the frequent visits. They might not realise they are making you uncomfortable, and you may be able to reach an agreement.If the landlord continues to ignore your requests to change, then you can inform them that as a landlord they have to be reasonable about how often they visit, and give you adequate notice before visiting the property (whether it is to carry out a property inspection or to do any repairs or maintenance).You can contact Tenancy Services on 0800 TENANCY (0800 83 62 62) for specific advice about how to enforce those rights.
