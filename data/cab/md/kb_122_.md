The landlord has arranged for building work to be done behind our rental but this makes access to our house very difficult. What can we do?

The landlord has an obligation to ensure your quiet enjoyment of the property. Ideally your landlord should have discussed this with you before your tenancy agreement began.Your landlord needs to act in such a way as to respect your peace and privacy. This might include, for example, only working during business hours and ensuring that access to your house is not impeded. Talk to your landlord about this, so they know about your concerns. You might be able to negotiate a rent reduction to make up for any inconvenience.If you really can’t reach an agreement with your landlord you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to end your tenancy early.For further advice call Tenancy Services on 0800 83 62 62.
