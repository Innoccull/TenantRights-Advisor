What types of decisions can the Tenancy Tribunal make?

The Tenancy Tribunal can formalise an agreement that the landlord and tenant have come to. This is called a mediator’s order.The Tenancy Tribunal can also issue an order:for work to be done (ie, a work order);
for money to be paid; 
a tenancy to be ended, and the tenant to leave;
of how much bond someone should pay, if the dispute is about a bond refund;
that compensation is to be paid if one of the parties suffered loss due to something that other party did or didn’t do;
that money is to be deducted from the wages or benefit of someone who owes money;
that a landlord can claim expenses associated with recovering debt from a tenant, if it is debt that the Tribunal ordered the tenant to pay.
The Tribunal can also order both parties to go back to mediation.You can find out more about decisions the Tribunal can make on the Tenancy Services website and the Aratohu Tenancy Advocate website.The Tenancy Tribunal does not deal with disputes between flatmates, or disputes in private boarding situations (including where the renter shares the property with the owner or a member of the owner’s family) - these are generally dealt with in the Disputes Tribunal. If you are not sure who can help with your renting-related dispute your local CAB can help you work it out.  Print
