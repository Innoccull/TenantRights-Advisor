How do I appeal a Tenancy Tribunal decision in the District Court?

If you think a Tenancy Tribunal decision is wrong, based on the law, you can file an appeal at the District Court.Â 
In some circumstances you do not have the right to appeal. For example, you cannot appeal:
against an interim order
a final order that you must pay someone if it is less than $1000 or
a final order to do work if it is worth less than $1000.
When and where to file your appeal
You must file your application for an appeal within 10 working days after the Tribunal decision was issued. You must file it at the District Court closest to where the original hearing took place.
You can have legal representation at the appeal hearing.
You must pay a filing fee of $200, and a court hearing fee ($900 after the first half day).
