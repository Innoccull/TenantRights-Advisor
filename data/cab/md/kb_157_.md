Our landlord moved overseas and we have no idea who to contact about getting repairs done. What can we do?

Your landlord should have appointed an agent before they left the country, and they should have advised you who the agent was and how to contact them. Your landlord is required by law to do this if they are going to be overseas for more than 21 days. If the bond is held by Tenancy Services the landlord must also notify them. If your landlord is away for more than 21 days and has not done these things, issue the landlord with a notice to remedy (using the landlord’s address as recorded on the tenancy agreement).  Give them a deadline to appoint an agent or provide the agent’s contact details. If the landlord does not do this within the time period you have given them, you can then make an application to the Tenancy Tribunal.    Print
