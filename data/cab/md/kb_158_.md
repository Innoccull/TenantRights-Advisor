Our tenancy agreement says that the landlord can charge us money if we need to break our fixed-term tenancy early. Is this legal?

A fixed term tenancy normally cannot be ended early. However, it can be ended early if both the tenant and the landlord agree to it.A tenancy agreement cannot include a specific fee related to the early termination of a fixed term tenancy. However, if your have your landlord’s agreement, they are entitled to recover “expenses reasonably incurred” as a result of the tenancy ending early.They must provide you with an itemised account of these expenses. Expenses might include the cost of advertising for new tenants, property manager’s fees associated with finding and signing up new tenants, etc. However, the fees charged have to be reasonable.If you don’t think the amount your landlord wants to charge you is reasonable, you can negotiate with them based on your own estimation of costs.If this doesn’t give you a satisfactory result you could take a case to the Tenancy Tribunal. Even though you have signed the agreement, the Tribunal could decide that the amount stated in it is unreasonable, or that the clause is unenforceable.You can check with Tenancy Services on 0800 83 62 62, or your local CAB.
