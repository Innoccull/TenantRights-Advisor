My landlord will not fix the problems with the rental property. What can I do?

Learn how to raise issues with your landlord, on the Aratohu Tenant Advocate website.If an urgent repair is needed, you can arrange the repairs and claim the costs back from your landlordIf the problem is urgent and is a serious threat to your health or safety, you can arrange to get repairs done yourself.“Urgent” means the state of disrepair is likely to cause injury to people or damage to property.As long as you try to contact the landlord first, the landlord must pay you back – so keep the receipt to show your landlord.For a non-urgent problem, you can give your landlord a 14 day notice to remedyIf the repair is not urgent, you can begin by sending your landlord a notice asking for the repair to be carried out (this is called a "14 day notice to remedy").You can use Tenancy Services' template letter which formally notifies the landlord that they have 14 days to fix the situation.Download the 14 day notice to remedy template from the Tenancy Services website.Keep a copy of the notice as proof that you sent it.If the repairs are not at least started by the end of the 14-day period, you can apply to the Tenancy TribunalIf your landlord fails to carry out the repair (or start carrying them out) within 14 days, you can apply for an order through the Tenancy Tribunal.For example, the Tenancy Tribunal can:order your landlord to get the work done themselves
reimburse you for the cost of getting the work done and/or
pay you compensation of losses you suffered due to the repairs not being done (minus depreciation).
