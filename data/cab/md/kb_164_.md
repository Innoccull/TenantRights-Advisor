How much notice do I have to give if I want to leave the place where I am boarding?

It depends on whether your boarding situation is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act.If you rent a room in a boarding house covered by the Residential Tenancy Act then you have to give your landlord 48 hours.If the Residential Tenancies Act does not cover your (for example, you share the house with your landlord) it depends on what it says in the boarding or house-sharing agreement (which can be written or verbal) you have with the landlord.If you do not have written or verbal agreement that specifies how much notice you should give before leaving, you should give “reasonable” notice (for example, between one and three weeks). You could discuss with your landlord and agree on what is reasonable.  Print
