I do not have a written agreement with my boarder. How do I make them leave?

If the board you provide is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act, you need to give your tenant 28 days’ notice to leave. Read more about this. Otherwise, how much notice you have to give should be what you and your boarder agreed to when they moved in.  If you did not agree to a specific notice period, and cannot agree on a notice period now, you can give your boarder “reasonable” notice to leave. How much notice is reasonable depends on the circumstances, for example, two to four weeks.  If your boarder refuses to leave, you might have to consider serving them with a trespass notice.  It is useful to have a signed, written agreement with your boarder to prevent any disputes about it.   Print
