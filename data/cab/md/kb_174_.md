What can I expect to pay as a flatmate?

If you are sharing a house or apartment with others you can expect to pay a share of:the rent;
the bond; and
the utilities and some grocery bills.
You should also have contents insurance to cover loss or destruction of your own possessions. If your name is on the tenancy agreement you can be liable for some of the cost of repairing damage to the rental property (whether intentionally or through negligence).   How much you pay as your share of the rent will depend on the location and the quality of your room and of the house. You can do some research on rent amounts for houses and apartments by looking at the general market value of rooms or houses in the area you are looking at renting in. If you are a university student, your university may have information about the expected costs of renting in the surrounding area.The Sorted website has an overview of the likely costs of flatting.
