My ex-flatmate trashed her room just before moving out. Am I liable for the cost of repairs?

Under the Residential Tenancies Act, all tenants (ie, those who have their names on the tenancy agreement) can be jointly liable if one of the occupants on the property - whether or not that person is a tenant - intentionally damages the rental property.If your name is not on the tenancy agreement, the landlord cannot pursue you for the damage.But if your name is on the agreement (ie, you are a tenant) then the landlord can pursue you for the cost of the repairs. If this happens to you, you could go to the Disputes Tribunal to get your money back from your ex-flatmate. Your local CAB can help you with this.One way to protect yourself from the risk of someone intentionally damaging your flat, is to get liability insurance. Your contents insurance may include this, so check with your insurer. More information about insurance for tenants is on the Tenancy Services website.Something to be aware of is that if a tenant accidentally causes damage to the rental property, neither the landlord nor the landlord's insurer can pursue the tenant to recover these costs.
