We all jointly signed a tenancy agreement for a flat a few months ago – but now I want to move out. How do I go about it?

Whether you and your co-tenants have a fixed-term or periodic tenancy, if you wish to leave but your co-tenants want to remain in the tenancy, you will need to get written permission from the remaining tenants and the landlord. All parties will need to keep a copy of this document. The remaining tenants may require you to find someone to take your place, or the landlord may be willing to find a replacement co-tenant. Note that some tenancy agreements do not allow tenants to leave and have their tenancy taken over by a replacement (ie, you would have to end the tenancy).If you have a periodic tenancy, another option is to give notice to end the tenancy altogether by giving your landlord notice. This means that your co-tenants also leave, or a new tenancy agreement begins with the remaining tenants.You should be able to get your share of the bond refunded if your name is on the Bond Lodgement form. You can call the Tenancy Services Bond Advice Line (0800 737 666) if you aren’t sure.More information is on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Tenancy Services website.  Print
