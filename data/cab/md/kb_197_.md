I am a tenant wanting to leave the  place I rent. My flatmate, who is not a tenant, wants to take over the tenancy. How do we do this?

This is called assignment. How you assign your tenancy to someone else is about the same whether you have a periodic tenancy or fixed term tenancy. You have a fixed term tenancyIf you have any flatmates who are already named on the tenancy agreement, they need to agree to it.You can then ask your landlord about arranging to have your flatmate replace you as a tenant on the tenancy agreement. You can use this Tenancy Services template to ask permission from your landlord.If your landlord also agrees to it, you will need to complete a Change of tenant form. You, the new tenant, and any other current tenants, have to sign it.You have a periodic tenancyIf you have a periodic tenancy, you can either follow the process for a fixed term tenancy, or just give notice to your landlord. This ends the tenancy for everyone renting the property, so if your flatmate wants to remain they can contact the landlord about it. They could decide to continue the tenancy with the remaining tenant, or start a new one with them.More informationMore information is on the Tenancy Services website.  Print
