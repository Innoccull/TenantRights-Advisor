Am I allowed to cut a second key for the place I rent? 

Under the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA), the landlord must provide locks and keys to the property, and tenants must return all keys, garage remotes or pass cards when the tenancy ends.The RTA does not restrict tenants from getting additional keys cut. However, if you cut an additional key for someone else to use, you could be liable if they misuse the key (for example, to steal from or damage the rental property).When you leave the tenancy you must return all of the keys, including any duplicates.More information about landlord and tenant responsibilities regarding keys and locks, is on the Tenancy Services website.
