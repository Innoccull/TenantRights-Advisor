As a tenant am I allowed to make minor changes to the property?  

From 11 February 2021, tenants can ask their landlords (in writing) if they want to make changes to the property, and if the change is minor the landlord must not unreasonably decline the request. The landlord must respond to their tenantâ€™s request, in writing, within 21 days.Definition of a minor changeA minor change is one that:presents a low risk of damage to the property;
would be easy to undo, so that at the end of the tenancy the property is in a reasonably similar condition to what it was at the beginning of the tenancy;
does not pose a health and safety risk, including during its installation and removal;
will not have any impact on other people;
does not require consent such as building consent;
does not breach any bylaw, body corporate rule, covenant or any other obligation or restriction on the premises.
Examples of minor changes include:securing furniture to protect against earthquake risk;
installing a baby gate;
putting up shelves;
installing television aerials;
putting in picture hooks.
The Tenancy Services website has a template the tenant can use to make their request, and another the landlord can use to respond to the request.Your landlord is entitled to consent to a minor change but with conditions. For example, they could say you can put up shelves but they have to be in a different location because the original location has wiring behind the wall.If your landlord unreasonably declines your request to make a minor change, or you think they have imposed unreasonable conditions on your request, you can take them to the Tenancy Tribunal. If your landlord does not respond to your request within 21 days you can contact Tenancy Services to arrange mediation, or apply to the Tenancy Tribunal.Your landlord cannot terminate your tenancy if you make a minor change without their consent, but they can issue you with a 14-day notice to remedy.At the end of your tenancy you are expected to undo any changes you have made to the premises, unless you and your landlord have agreed otherwise.
