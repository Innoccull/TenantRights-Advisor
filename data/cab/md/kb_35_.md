What rights do we have as tenants living in a garage?

Even though the place you’re living may not be a lawful rental property, you will be protected by tenancy law. Illegally converted garages or sheds, buildings without the proper consents, commercial premises and premises that have been deemed unsafe and unsanitary by the local authority, are all examples of unlawful residential premises. These types of premises do not meet the minimum standards for residential rentals.If you are living in a rental like this, from 27 August 2019 you are covered by the Residential Tenancies Act and you have the right to ask your landlord to comply with their responsibilities. This includes their responsibility to comply with building, health and safety laws, cleanliness, maintenance and smoke alarms, insulation, bond lodgement, proper notices of rent increases and rules about terminating a tenancy.If the landlord will not comply with these obligations you can apply the Tenancy Tribunal. The Tenancy Tribunal can make a range of orders, such as ordering the landlord to do what’s needed to make the premises lawful.More information is on the Tenancy Services brochure.  Print
