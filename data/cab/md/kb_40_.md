What could I be fined if I am in breach of tenancy law?

It depends on how serious the breach is, but yes – landlords and tenants could be fined for being in breach of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA).The Tenancy Tribunal can order exemplary damages Exemplary damages are a fine, which the person in breach of the RTA must pay to the other. (It is different from compensation, where a tenant or landlord is left with a cost or burden because of the other party not meeting their obligations, and the amount to be paid reflects the affected person’s loss).If a tenant or landlord is repeatedly in breach of the RTA, the affected person can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal for exemplary damages.For example:The Tenancy Tribunal can order a landlord to pay their tenant up to:$750 for not giving their tenant a copy of a written, signed tenancy agreement
$1500 for not responding to their tenant’s written consent for fixtures
$1800 for interfering with the supply of services to the rental
$7200 for not meeting their obligations around cleanliness, maintenance, smoke alarms or Healthy Homes Standards
The Tenancy Tribunal can order a tenant to pay their landlord up to:$3000 for harassment of another tenant or a neighbour
$1500 for subletting the rental without the landlord’s written permission
$1500 for not allowing their landlord to enter the premises when the landlord is entitled to enter
$3000 if they are a boarding house tenant, harassing a neighbour
