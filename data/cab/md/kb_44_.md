Can my landlord stop me from having guests without the landlord's permission?

No.
As a tenant you are entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the property you are renting. This includes the right to have visitors.
Learn about what quiet enjoyment means.
Even if your tenancy agreement says you need your landlord's consent to have guests, they cannot enforce it
If your tenancy agreement has a clause saying that you cannot have visitors without your landlord’s consent, this clause is unenforceable. This means, if your landlord applies to the Tenancy Tribunal to enforce the clause, they would not succeed.
Other examples of unenforceable tenancy agreement clauses include requirements to:
have the property professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy
pay an unreasonably high fee for terminating a fixed term tenancy early
pay additional bond in return for being allowed to keep a dog on the property
get consent from the landlord before you hold a party on the property.
You can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to resolve a disagreement with your landlord
If you and your landlord disagree on a clause in your tenancy agreement, either of you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to resolve it.
