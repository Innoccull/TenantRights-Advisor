My friend and I have joint tenancy but my friend is having money problems. Can the landlord make me liable for the full amount of the rent? 

If you and your friend are both named as tenants on the tenancy agreement, then you have a joint tenancy. If two or more people are named on the tenancy agreement they are jointly liable for payment of the rent. This means that your landlord can pursue you for any overdue rent, including the other tenant’s share of the rent.If this happens you have options for getting reimbursement from the other joint tenant.    Print
