My tenancy agreement says that I will be charged a late fee if I don’t pay my rent on time – can they do this?

No, they cannot.As a tenant you are responsible for paying your rent on time. However your landlord is not entitled to charge you a late fee if your rent is late. Even if your tenancy agreement has a clause that says you will be charged interest or late fees for late payment this would not be enforceable in the Tenancy Tribunal. Read about the process your landlord must follow to deal with late rent payment.
