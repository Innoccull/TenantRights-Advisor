How much rent in advance is a landlord allowed to ask for at the beginning of a tenancy?

Your landlord may ask for one or two weeks’ rent in advance, depending on whether you will be paying rent weekly or fortnightly. For example, if you will be paying rent fortnightly you can expect to pay two weeks’ rent in advance at the beginning of your tenancy.This counts as the first rent payment, so your landlord cannot ask you to pay any more rent until all of that rent has been used up.Two weeks’ rent in advance is the most a landlord can ask for.More information is on the Tenancy Services website.   Print
