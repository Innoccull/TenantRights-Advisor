How much notice should I get about a rent increase?

If you have a periodic tenancy, your landlord must give you written warning of a rent increase 60 days before it will take place.If you are in a fixed term tenancy, your landlord cannot increase your rent at all unless it is allowed for in the tenancy agreement.(Find out about the difference between a periodic tenancy and a fixed term tenancy.)More information about the notice requirements and what can be done if incorrect notice is given, is on the Aratohu Tenant Advocacy website.If your landlord is trying to enforce a rent increase without giving the right amount of notice, read our information about how to resolve this.
