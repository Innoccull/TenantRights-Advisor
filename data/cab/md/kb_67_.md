Our landlord sold the rental property – can the new landlord increase our rent?

If your landlord sells the rental property, then unless vacant possession was a condition of the sale, the new landlord takes over the existing tenancy agreement.This means your new landlord cannot raise your rent unless it has been 12 months since your last rent increase.If it has been at least 12 months since your last rent increase, your new landlord can increase your rent but must give you proper notice in advance. (Landlords can only increase rent for a fixed term tenancy if the tenancy agreement allows it.)What your old and new landlords must do when the property changes ownershipYour old landlord and new landlord must complete a “Change of Landlord/Agent” form. This tells Tenancy Services of the change of ownership, and updates the bond record to show your new landlord's name.Your old landlord must tell you who your new landlord is and give the new landlord a copy of your existing tenancy agreement.When your new landlord takes over the rental property, they must tell you their name, contact details, an address for service, and how they want you to pay the rent (for example, their bank account number).More informationVisit the Tenancy Services website for more information about change of landlord and what should happen when a landlord sells their rental property.
