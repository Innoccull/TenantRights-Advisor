Can a landlord advertise a rental property without stating the rent amount? 

Except for service tenancies, a landlord must state the rent amount when they advertise a residential property for rent.A landlord cannot encourage prospective tenants to “bid” for a rental property (as you might bid for goods in an auction), nor can they invite tenants to offer more rent than the amount advertised.However, a prospective tenant can voluntarily offer to pay a landlord more than the amount advertised.More information is on the Tenancy website.
