Should I do a property inspection report before signing a tenancy agreement?

Yes! A tenant should complete a property inspection report with the landlord before signing the tenancy agreement.This involves going through the premises and recording the condition of each room and any furniture or appliances provided by the landlord. The property inspection ensures that both parties agree about the state of the house before a tenancy agreement is signed. It is a good idea to attach a signed and dated copy of this to the tenancy agreements of both the landlord and the tenant so that you have a record of this.It is also a good idea to take photos of the property, just in case there are any disputes later on.Â   Print
