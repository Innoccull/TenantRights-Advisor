Our landlord is constantly coming around to inspect the property. Is that allowed?

The landlord can only carry out one house inspection every four weeks, and they have to give you adequate notice every time.If the landlord is coming around too often try and talk them about the problem, but if that doesn't work you can seek help from the Tenancy Tribunal or talk to your local CAB.
