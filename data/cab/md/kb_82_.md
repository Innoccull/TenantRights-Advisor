Can a tenant make their landlord  follow certain hygiene measures when they enter the property for inspection? 

Tenants cannot unreasonably refuse an inspection. If you are a tenant and are at risk of severe illness from Covid-19, you may have reasonable grounds for refusal. You can read the advice for people at risk of severe illness from Covid-19, on the Ministry of Health website. If you have concerns about this you could suggest to your landlord that they do a virtual property inspection.If there is going to be an in-person inspection, everyone present should confirm that they are not unwell nor displaying any relevant symptoms  before entering the property.If you and your landlord cannot agree on precautions to take for the next property inspection you can follow the guidance on our articles about resolving disputes between landlords and tenants.
