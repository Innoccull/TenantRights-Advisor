My landlord wants to do a virtual property inspection – do I have to agree to it? 

A virtual inspection might be in the form of a Zoom meeting, where you walk around the rental property with your device, showing your landlord how it looks. Your landlord might want to do the inspection virtually (online) because they are at high risk if they get Covid-19, for example.You do not have to agree to a virtual property inspectionIf you do not want to allow a virtual property inspection, but an in-person inspection is not possible, you could:ask the landlord to postpone the inspection until they can do it in person
offer to report any necessary repairs to them (for example, via email, so you both have a record of this) or
ask the landlord to an in-person inspection when the tenants are not home.
If you agree to a virtual property inspectionIf you agree to a virtual property inspection, remember that your landlord cannot ask you to enter parts of the building if doing so could endanger your health and safety.
