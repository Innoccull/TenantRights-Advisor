What rights and obligations do I have as a boarder under the Residential Tenancies Act?

If you are a tenant in a boarding house covered by the Residential Tenancies Act you have more protection than you would as a private boarder.You must be given a written boarding house tenancy agreement. This agreement sets out things like what you are expected to pay in rent and what facilities and services you can expect in return.From July 2021 boarding houses that are covered by the Residential Tenancies Act must meet the Healthy Homes Standards.If the landlord of a boarding house has house rules relating to the use and enjoyment of the boarding house and the services provided, they must give you a copy of the house rules. They must also have a copy on display in the premises at all times, and give you seven days' notice of any change to the house rules.Other rights and obligations you have as a boarding house tenant are:you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal to have house rules varied or removed;
you must not interfere with any lock (except with the landlord's consent);
you may terminate your boarding house tenancy with 48 hours’ notice;
you must be given 24 hours' written notice before the landlord can enter your room (eg, for an inspection) unless
you agree otherwise, or 
the landlord believes that there is an emergency or a serious risk to life or property;

at the end of the tenancy you must remove your property, leave your room in a reasonably clean and tidy condition, and return any keys.
