Who pays for the power in a boarding house tenancy?

The landlord is responsible for all outgoings of the boarding house, unless it can be directly attributed to your roomIf you are staying in a boarding house that is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act, your landlord is responsible for the outgoings (rates, insurance etc).The only time you have to pay for an outgoing, is if it can be directly attributed to your room.For example:if your room has its own meter, then you must pay the power bill for your room
if your room has its own internet connection, you must pay the internet bill for your room.
This is true even if your boarding house tenancy agreement says your landlord can split the power bill among the tenants (see a Tenancy Tribunal order about this situation).Find out more about who pays for what in a boarding house tenancy, on the Aratohu Tenant Advocate website.Learn about what types of boarding houses are covered by the Residential Tenancies Act,  Print
