How Tenancy Services can help with your rights: Improvement notices and enforceable undertakings
What is an improvement notice and how do I get one?

Residential Tenancies Act 1986, ss 126H-126M, Schedule 1A

Tenancy Services can give your landlord notice telling them what rules they’re breaking under your tenancy agreement or the Act (such as failing to give you smoke alarms) with a deadline for them to make the improvement.

Notice can be given for problems that are already happening, or that are likely to happen. It’s an unlawful act for your landlord to ignore the notice, and if they do they’ll have to pay a penalty of $3,000.

If you believe your landlord is not complying with the Act, you can contact the Tenancy Compliance and Investigations team on the Tenancy Services website. Fill out the form online, here (or, go to: www.tenancy.govt.nz and search “Contact the Compliance and Investigations Team”.
What if the improvement notice doesn’t fix the problem?

Residential Tenancies Act 1986, ss 126N-126R, Schedule 1A

If the improvement order doesn’t solve the problem, an enforceable undertaking is the next step for more serious breaches of your tenancy rights. This involves Tenancy Services coming to an agreement with your landlord about what they need to fix or pay, with a $1,000 penalty if they don’t comply by a specified deadline.
