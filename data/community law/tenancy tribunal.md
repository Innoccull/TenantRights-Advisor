The Tenancy Tribunal: A court to decide tenancy disputes
What is the Tenancy Tribunal and what can it do?

Residential Tenancies Act 1986, ss 77, 102

The Tenancy Tribunal is a type of court that specialises in disputes between tenants and landlords. It’s faster than going to a normal court. It’s also a lot cheaper – you’ll pay an application fee of about $20 and you won’t usually have a lawyer at the Tribunal hearing.

The Tenancy Tribunal has wide powers to resolve various types of tenancy disputes. This can include:

    deciding whether there’s a legally binding tenancy agreement between the two sides
    deciding whether an agreement is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act
    ordering a tenant to pay overdue rent, or ordering a landlord to refund rent that’s been overcharged
    deciding whether a notice given to end the tenancy was legally valid and who has the right to have possession of the property
    ordering one side to do something required by the tenancy agreement, or to stop doing something that goes against the agreement
    ordering one side to pay compensation to the other for breaching the agreement
    ordering work to be done – for example, ordering the tenant to fix damage, or ordering the landlord to do repairs or maintenance work.

The Tenancy Tribunal can order work to be done or money to be paid up to a value of $100,000. Claims for more than this can be dealt with through the District Court.
How do I take a dispute to the Tenancy Tribunal?

You can apply online, or you can apply using a paper copy of the form, which you can get from a Tenancy Services office. The processes are explained on the Tenancy Services website – get more information or apply online here (or, go to www.tenancy.govt.nz and search “making an application”).

It costs $20.44 to apply to the Tenancy Tribunal. If the dispute has been to mediation first, one of you will have already paid this fee

Tenancy Tribunal hearings are less formal than the courts. The person who hears the dispute and makes the decision for the Tribunal is called the “adjudicator”. You and the landlord both get a chance to tell them your side of the story and to answer any questions the adjudicator has. You can also bring witnesses to give evidence. It’s usually more effective to have witnesses give their evidence in person, rather than bringing letters or statements.

The two sides usually don’t have a lawyer or representative and instead represent themselves – lawyers or representatives are only allowed in limited situations, like where the amount being disputed is more than $6000.

You can bring a support person with you.

You should bring all documents or other material that supports your claim (your “evidence”) – for example, your tenancy agreement, bank statements, rent books, and any notices that either side have given the other (with two extra copies of everything for the adjudicator and the other party).

The Tenancy Tribunal adjudicator will make a decision about the dispute and put this in writing (this is called an “order”). The decision is legally binding: you and the landlord have to follow it.

The hearing is usually open to the public. If you don’t go to the hearing, your case could be dismissed.

You can get your name and identifying details removed from the official records with a suppression order, unless the Tenancy Tribunal decides it is justified for your details to be made public. If your claim was successful, the Tribunal will very likely grant name suppression. Even if your claim is unsuccessful, the Tribunal will usually only decline a request for name suppression if your conduct was particularly bad.
What if I’m not happy with the Tenancy Tribunal’s decision?

Apply for a rehearing with the Tenancy Tribunal

If something went wrong with the Tribunal process, you can apply to the Tribunal for a rehearing. For example, if you weren’t notified of the hearing, or if there’s new evidence that would change the outcome of the hearing.

You have 5 working days to apply for a rehearing with the District Court, and its free to do so. You’ll have to give your reasons for applying.

Appeal the decision to the District court

You can challenge the Tenancy Tribunal decision by appealing it to the District Court if the Tribunal order was for money or work worth $1000 or more. You can challenge it on the grounds that the Tribunal got the facts wrong, or got the law wrong, or both.
You have 10 working days to apply for an appeal with the District Court, and it costs $200 to do so.

To win your appeal you’ll have to persuade the District Court Judge that there’s a clear and convincing reason to overturn the Tenancy Tribunal’s decision. The appeal judge will take into account that the Tribunal is an experienced specialist body that’s used to dealing with tenancy disputes, and so will tend to be cautious about overturning its decisions.

The rule that the District Court will be cautious about overturning a Tenancy Tribunal decision also applies when your landlord doesn’t like a decision that was in your favour, as shown in the following example.

How long do I have to appeal the Tenancy Tribunal’s decision?

Residential Tenancies Act 1986, s 117(6) Case: [2018] NZHC 133

You’ve got 10 working days after the date of the Tenancy Tribunal’s decision to file your appeal with the District Court. There are no exceptions to this time limit, so if you’re late you lose your chance to appeal.

What can I do if the landlord doesn’t follow the Tenancy Tribunal’s order?

Residential Tenancies Act 1986, ss 106, 107

The order is legally binding and you can go to the District Court to get it enforced.
