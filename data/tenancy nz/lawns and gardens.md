Tenants and landlords are responsible for different tasks in the grounds of a property.
Tenants responsibilities

Tenants must keep the property reasonably clean and tidy. This includes mowing the lawns and weeding the gardens. Tenants won't have to do this if the landlord has agreed to do this in the tenancy agreement.

If a tenant wants to remove or prune a tree, shrub or hedge, they should get the landlord’s written consent first. If they do this, the tenant is then responsible for removing the cuttings.
Landlords responsibilities

Landlords are usually responsible for pruning and maintaining trees, shrubs and hedges. If they are, they would normally remove the cuttings too. This minimises the risk of damage.

Some trees and shrubs may need special care, skill or knowledge to maintain them. They could also be protected species, or of local/historical interest and can’t be removed.

The landlord should also make sure any trees are safe. Dangerous trees, shrubs or hedges might include trees damaged by storms or growing towards electrical lines.
Issues with lawns and gardens

You should talk to the other person if there is an issue with the lawns, gardens, or trees. If the property’s grounds aren’t being maintained properly, this is a breach of tenancy laws.

Breaches of the Act

You can also talk to the local council for information and guidance. This is important if there is an issue with your neighbours trees or common property.
