Quiet enjoyment means being able to enjoy reasonable peace, comfort and privacy, and allowing others to enjoy the same.

Tenants have the right to the ‘quiet enjoyment’ of the house they rent. This means the landlord can’t harass the tenant or interfere with their reasonable peace, comfort and privacy.

Tenants also need to respect the peace, comfort and privacy of their neighbours or other tenants. The landlord should take any reasonable steps to make sure none of their tenants interfere with each other’s quiet enjoyment.

Landlords need to give the correct notice to access the property.
If quiet enjoyment is breached

If you think your landlord is breaching your quiet enjoyment, you can issue them with a notice to remedy. In the notice, you give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to resolve the problem.

If they don’t comply within the timeframe, you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal. If you want to ask the Tribunal to end the tenancy, you need to give the other person at least 14 days to fix the problem.

If you’re a landlord:

    make sure all necessary maintenance, repairs and cleaning are done before the tenant moves in
    remember it’s your tenant’s home – respect their peace and privacy
    know how and when you can enter the tenant’s house
    give proper notice before doing repairs and maintenance
    talk to the tenant before starting repairs or maintenance that involve noise or fumes.

If you’re a tenant:

    try not to make too much noise
    don’t disturb other tenants or neighbours
    remember that the landlord has the same right as anyone else to knock on the door and speak to you (unless this happens so often it becomes harassment)
    allow access for necessary repairs, if the landlord gives the correct notice
    allow reasonable access for viewings by potential tenants or buyers.
