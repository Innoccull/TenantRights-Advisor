Tenants must get consent before making changes to the property.

Tenants can't renovate, alter or add major fixtures to the property unless the landlord agrees. Any changes must either:

    be in line with the tenancy agreement, or
    the tenant must have the landlord's written consent (the landlord can’t unreasonably withhold consent).

Tenants can't remove fixtures if it will cause damage to the property that can’t be repaired. Sometimes landlords let tenants add new fixtures on the condition that they become the landlord’s property at the end of the tenancy (because of the damage that would occur if removed).

Any fixture put up by a tenant that isn’t removed at the end of the tenancy becomes the property of the landlord. This doesn’t apply if the landlord and tenant have come to a different agreement.

If you’re a tenant and you cause damage when removing fixtures, tell the landlord. The landlord can then tell you whether they want you to fix the damage, or compensate them.

Tenants can make minor changes to the property

From 11 February 2021 under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, tenants can ask to make changes to the rental property and landlords must not decline if the change is minor.

Minor changes to the property include fixtures like:

    curtains replacing corded blinds
    visual fire alarms and doorbells
    baby-proofing, e.g. a baby gate, cord tensioners or cord cleats for corded blinds
    earthquake-proofing, e.g. securing a bookshelf to the wall.

Tenant responsibilities for making a minor change

    Make the request to the landlord in writing.
    Receive landlord’s permission (which must be within 21 days) before making the minor change to the property (the landlord can ask to extend the timeframe).
    Pay the installation costs (unless otherwise agreed with the landlord).
    At the end of the tenancy, remove the fitting that was installed (unless landlord agrees it can stay).
    Return the property to substantially the same condition it was in before the minor change was made.
