name and identifying detail and must pay the tenant s immediately calculated a shown in table below description landlord tenant rent arrears filing fee reimbursement exemplary damage failure to lodge bond bond damage breach total award net award total payable by to all the party attended the hearing the tenant appeared with a support person the owner purchased the property in and agreed to rent it to mr and his partner for the clarity i will refer to a the owner mr a the landlord and the tenant s a the tenant the owner wa not sure at the time of purchase if the premise complied with the residential tenancy due to it age being and because he had not inspected it before renting it out the premise are a bedroom house with acre of land and shedding the landlord then signed a tenancy agreement with the tenant renting out the house the owner consented to this the landlord continued to rent the balance of the land and shed for his stock off the owner the tenancy agreement listed mr a the landlord and the tenant s a the tenant the start date of this tenancy wa the tenant received support for the tenancy through and the landlord became a registered supplier to them receiving the bond and rent in advance mr said that he wa told that he could not lodge the bond because there wa already a bond paid for the premise so he held on to the money during the tenancy the landlord used the bond money to cover cost and rent he found owing the tenant sought compensation exemplary damage refund of the bond following the end of the tenancy and reimbursement of the filling fee is this tenancy assigned or wa it sublet to the tenant the respondent landlord is the tenant of the property pursuant to a tenancy agreement with the owner the issue is whether the tenancy wa assigned or whether the landlord is a sub landlord and the tenant a sub tenant the residential tenancy act defines assignment a a transfer to a person of all the right that a tenant ha under a tenancy agreement see section rta a tenant may assign a tenancy with the consent of the landlord the effect of this is that from the date of the assignment that is that the date a new tenancy begin the outgoing tenant cease to be responsible to the landlord for obligation imposed by the agreement and see section bc rta a sub tenancy however is a tenancy agreement between a tenant sub landlord and another person sub tenant where the tenant remains liable under a tenancy agreement to the landlord a sub tenant is the grantee of a tenancy with the right to occupy the premise exclusively or otherwise for rent reflecting the definition of tenant and tenancy in section of the rta in the current circumstance a tenancy agreement wa signed by the party the start date of this tenancy wa the landlord received tenancy entry cost from on communicated with the tenant managed the tenancy and referred repair and concern to the owner the landlord argued that this wa a casual arrangement that he organised to help the tenant out i disagree he wa fully involved with the tenancy from signing an agreement a the landlord receiving rent and bond being called on with the owner for repair and lawn mowing the tenant had exclusive right to occupy the i find that this wa a landlord tenant relationship and that the premise were sublet to the tenant by the landlord i dismiss the argument that this wa a casual agreement between the party the tenancy is valid and the rta applies to all tenancy between a landlord and tenant both the owner and landlord were involved with the management of the tenancy and i find it appropriate to join the owner a a party to the proceeding for the clarity in this i will refer to mr a the landlord and the tenant s a the tenant how much is owing in rent the tenant disputed the amount claimed for rent arrears at the end of the tenancy the rent record provided by the landlord stated owing at the end of the tenancy the tenant agreed that she had not paid rent for rent for her tenancy on paid the landlord payment of and on a further wa paid this wa amounted to for the bond and for rent in advance a bond record wa supplied by the landlord and recorded a starting amount of the record showed where the landlord deducted rent owing from this amount the rent record did not record the payment from a rent in advance when this wa taken into consideration the rent became in credit the party agreed that the tenant owed rent for she wa at the tenancy being i find that the tenant owes in rent arrears at the end of the tenancy how much is owed for water there wa no individual water metre installed at the premise and no way to determine the water use exclusively attributable to this tenancy see section rta the claim for compensation for water use residential tenancy act standard the tenant s claim that the landlord ha breached the landlord s obligation under section bb of rta which requires compliance with the tenant s considers that the landlord ha failed to comply with the ventilation standard the draught stopping standard and the insulation standard ha confirmed that when there are multiple claim for a breach under a single section section here then order of exemplary damage can be made i will therefore address the question of exemplary damage for all claimed section breach below the ventilation standard set out minimum expectation around window and door and in particular the area of door and window that are openable the standard also requires that each kitchen and bathroom have extractor fan installed with a minimum defined extraction capacity the doe provide exemption in specific circumstance the landlord and owner agreed that the premise did not have an extractor fan installed in the kitchen or the bathroom saying that the premise wa rented on the condition that the tenant knew that it may not comply with the the landlord and owner confirmed that they relied on the tenant telling them what wa wrong and then they would fix it immediately they said money wa not the issue but getting service people to attend wa delayed due to increased demand the landlord took to install an extractor fan in the bathroom which wa completed just before the tenancy ended the kitchen range hood wa still in the garage i find that they have breached the ventilation standard draught stopping the tenant s claim that the landlord ha breached the landlord s obligation under section bb of in relation to the draught stopping standard the draught stopping standard requires that residential premise be free from unreasonable gap and hole that are not an intentional part of the building which allow draught to arise the window in the main bedroom did not shut properly some of the hinge were bent and there were gap to the outside the tenant said that it wa a sunny warm house but she needed to be able to open and shut the window she said that at the start of the tenancy she told the landlord partner about them but nothing wa done photograph were provided in support the owner found a facebook post later in the tenancy where the tenant raised concern about the standard of the premise and noted the problem with the window the owner organised to get them replaced they were repaired on tenancy ended on the landlord said that he did not know about the window before this and they were waiting for the tenant to let them know what needed repairing a tenant ha the obligation to inform the landlord of any damage or repair a soon a possible after a tenancy begin but a landlord is required to comply with the within of any tenancy that commenced after when i consider this with the statement that the landlord had not looked at the premise before renting it out i find that the landlord ha breached the obligation comply with the ventilation standard insulation the tenant s claim that the landlord ha breached the obligation under section of by failing to insulate the premise in accordance with regulation from all residential premise must be insulated to a minimum standard where the premise were insulated before the ceiling insulation must have an r value of or for house of a brick or concrete block construction the underfloor insulation must have an r value of the insulation must be in reasonable condition where insulation is installed after the minimum r value for ceiling insulation is in zone and and for zone zone cover the island and central the minimum r value for underfloor insulation is there are exception to these requirement for example where it is not reasonably practicable or where there is a habitable space above or below the ceiling or floor that would otherwise have to be insulated the party agreed that the premise were not insulated i find they have committed an unlawful act by breaching the ventilation standard the draught standard and the insulation standard where a party ha committed an unlawful act intentionally the may award exemplary damage where it is satisfied it would be just to do so having regard to the party s intent the effect of the unlawful act the interest of the other party and the public interest see section rta breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section a and a rta over and above the requirement to comply with landlord are to provide and maintain premise in a reasonable state of repair see section b in considering the requirement of section rta i conclude that by not looking at the premise before renting them out and stating that they probably do not comply that the landlord and owner have ignored their responsibility ignorance is no excuse for noncompliance it is not the role of the tenant to alert the landlord to their noncompliance with the requirement of the or there is a positive obligation on the landlord to comply i find that these breach are intentional this is strengthened by the reliance on the tenant to tell the landlord and owner what wa wrong with the this hand off approach doe not absolve the party from their responsibility the effect of the unlawful act for the tenant wa a draughty and possibly a premise unable to be secured without extractor fan mould is far more likely to occur and home with window that do not seal are very hard to heat the legal requirement to provide a warm insulated healthy home for tenant is what the have been introduced for and this is in the public interest i consider it just to make an order the maximum award for breaching this section is and there have been breach of this section i find it just to award an order of of the maximum being an order of wa there a breach of the tenant s quiet a landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace comfort or privacy of the tenant in their use of the see section residential tenancy act breaching this obligation in circumstance that amount to harassment is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section and a rta harassment mean to trouble worry or distress or to wear out tire or exhaust and indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person v dodds civ the tenant provided a text from landlord s partner saying that she had to leave because she had people at her property that the landlord did not like this wa later changed the landlord also sent the tenant a text saying that the owner could do what the fuck he want mhe is the owner so do what you have to the text were inappropriate and incorrect but i do not find that these text amount to a breach of the tenant s quiet enjoyment amounting to harassment this claim is dismissed the tenant s claim the landlord ha not lodged the bond with the within the required time a landlord must send any bond payment to the within working day after the payment is received see section residential tenancy act breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which the may award exemplary damage up to a maximum of see section and a residential tenancy act the landlord agrees that he wa paid the bond by and tried to lodge it but because he had paid the owner his bond he wa told that he could not lodge a bond for this tenancy the bond centre confirms that there is no bond lodged with this address and the owner confirmed that he had not lodged the first bond the landlord could have lodged the bond and failed to when asked where the money wa he said it wa long gone and put toward the tenant cost and rent arrears he believed that the tenant owed he did not have the fund now to cover the bond i find they have committed an unlawful act where a party ha committed an unlawful act intentionally the may award exemplary damage where it is satisfied it would be just to do so having regard to the party s intent the effect of the unlawful act the interest of the other party and the public interest see section residential tenancy act in consideration of the section rta i find that this wa an intentional breach a bond is not the landlord money but the tenant to be held in trust by the bond centre for end of tenancy claim the landlord ha used the tenant s money and confirmed that none of it is left the landlord said that he wa a first time landlord and did not know the requirement of the rta this is no excuse it is the responsibility of a landlord to know and comply with the requirement of the rta the consequence for the tenant is that she could not access the bond money for which she could be held liable to repay to it is in the public interest that tenant bond money is held by an independent bond centre a security for all party i find it just to make an award of bond refund the tenant ha applied for refund of the bond the landlord ha a claim against the bond but ha not filed a counterclaim with section b residential tenancy act provides that where a tenant applies for refund of the bond and the landlord seek payment from the bond the landlord must file an application setting out the detail of the counterclaim because the landlord ha not filed a counterclaim the bond is refunded in full to the tenant the tenant claimed that the premise were not fully fenced for child and that this wa agreed upon the premise were located down a long driveway and were situated on a working farm there wa an incident where a child wa found down the road there wa no evidence that the party agreed this wa a term of the tenancy this claim is dismissed the tenant said that she wa told her rent included the lawn being mown and the garden being done this never happened the landlord said that this wa not agreed to but the owner and himself mowed the lawn on occasion and when asked there wa no evidence provided that the rent included lawn and garden maintenance this claim is dismissed because the tenant s ha substantially succeeded with the claim i have reimbursed the filing fee t
