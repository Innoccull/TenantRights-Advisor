did nothing about it d that the tenant thought that the landlord wa undertaking major repair and therefore they did not need to clean it thoroughly e that the landlord spent very little on the property over and that the tenant looked after repair themselvesf that the tenant improved the property by installing a heat pump which they have not been given credit for did the tenant comply with their obligation at the end of the tenancy at the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premise reasonably clean and tidy remove all rubbish return all key and security device and leave all chattel provided for their benefit see section eiiv residential tenancy act i am satisfied from the photograph provided by the landlord and the description of the work undertaken in the cleaning invoice that the tenant did not leave the premise reasonably clean and tidy and did not remove all rubbish i do not accept the tenant s submission that they did not need to leave the property clean because the landlord wa renovating the nature and the extent of the dirtiness boarded on unhygienic such a dog faeces being left on the carpet and i do not consider that it appropriate to leave the property in the state that wa simply because the landlord wa intending on doing repair i am also satisfied that the tenant removed curtain and track i record that i would not have expected all curtain to have been at the end of their life after and even if this wa the case the track should still be up i am satisfied that the cost sought by the landlord are appropriate the amount for the skip wa a percentage of the total cost incurred by the landlord and is reasonable the landlord used the skip for other reason such a removal of building waste which the tenant ha not been charged for the amount ordered are proved is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premise a landlord must prove that damage to the premise occurred during the tenancy and is more than fair wear and tear if this is established to avoid liability the tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage are liable for the action of people at the premise with their permission see section a and b rta where the damage is careless and occurs after section applies if the landlord becomes aware of the damage after the damage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant prof otherwise where the damage is caused carelessly and is covered by the landlord s insurance the tenant s liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or rent or market rent in the case of a tenant paying income related rent see section ba rta where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord s insurance the tenant s liability is limited to rent or market rent see section rta where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant s conduct the property is treated a if it is not insured against the damage see section baa rta tenant are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which result from any activity at the premise that is an imprisonable offence this applies to anything the tenant doe and anything done by a person they are responsible for see section b rta damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and take the necessary step to achieve that purpose damage is also intentional where a person doe something or allows a situation to continue knowing that damage is a certainty see nzhc carpet i am satisfied that the damage to the carpet is intentional the tenant kept a dog at the property in breach of the agreement and the landlord issue a notice for a dog in which the tenant complied with however in an inspection in the landlord found a dog locked a bedroom it is this bedroom where the carpet wa ripped by the dog and where the landlord found dog faeces after the tenant moved out the tenant accepts that the dog ha caused damage but say that carpet is old and wa nearing the end of it life the landlord ha only claimed a percentage of the total cost of the replacement carpet the amount asked for is for the part of the carpet in the bedroom which wa intentionally damaged i am satisfied that the damage ion the bedroom is intentional the tenant wa in breach of his agreement and thy knew that damage wa occurring and took no step to rectify it in bedroom is expected to last i accept the landlord s evidence that they have replaced the whole of the carpet in the house but are seeking are lesser amount taking into account depreciation and betterment i have taken into account depreciation and betterment and have awarded the landlord in particular this take into account that the landlord ha had to replace the carpet earlier than it otherwise would have a a result of the tenant s action in the wall and painting the landlord say that the tenant left numerous hole in the wall and on the wall the tenant say that it repaired all of the hole in the wall and they just needed painting i consider the hole in the wall and the graffiti intentional however when i take into account the age of the paint work and the number of people in the home then i consider that the house wa nearing a time that it would have needed repainting i accept that the landlord would have needed to do some preparatory work before the property wa painted especially in area where the tenant had plastered over hole there are some hole in the property that were over the time frame for bringing a claim to the tribunal is taking all the above into account the amount awarded are proven other damage claimed i consider that the tenant also broke the wardrobe door broke some of the door frame deliberately removed the laundry tub causing damage broke the toilet cistern removed the towel rail and toilet roll holder and scratched the bathtub and broke light fitting the damage is more than fair wear and tear and the tenant ha not disproved liability for the damage the amount ordered are proved i have taken into account betterment and depreciation the landlord should be returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached their obligation and should not be better or worse off in calculating depreciation i have taken into account the age and condition of the item at the start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan i have reduced some of the landlord s claimed cost to better reflect the depreciation and the nature and extent of the damage claim not proven i do not consider the tenant should be responsible for acid washing the driveway there wa no evidence provided by the landlord to show that this wa necessary there wa also no evidence to support the landlord s claim for new door there were picture of all the door at the beginning of the tenancy and the age of the door in the house suggests that they are nearing the end of their lifespan because ha substantially succeeded with the claim i have reimbursed the filing fee t prowse
