scheduled in person on and time available before any the hearing wa held by teleconference on both party attended the hearing the landlord ha applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the tenant s obligation exemplary damage and compensation for methamphetamine testing and decontamination given the urgent nature of the claim and that no in person hearing date were available until this matter wa scheduled for a remote hearing to consider the claim for termination and exemplary damage only the claim for compensation is adjourned to another date should the tenancy be terminated the may terminate a tenancy for breach where due to the nature or extent of the breach it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate see section residential tenancy act the rta where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on the tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within and establish that the tenant ha failed to do so where the breach is not capable of remedy the landlord is not expressly required to serve a breach notice on the tenant a breach is not capable to remedy where the thing done or it effect can not be undone however unless the breach is serious the usually requires the landlord to have warned the tenant about the likely consequence of continued breach before it will exercise it discretion to terminate the landlord claim the tenant ha used the premise unlawfully by using or permitting the smoking of methamphetamine in the a tenant must not use the premise or permit the premise to be used for an unlawful purpose see section b rta breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section ac and a rta tenant are liable for the action of others who are at the premise with their permission see section rta it is unlawful to posse or consume methamphetamine see section a and schedule of the landlord provided a pre tenancy methamphetamine test establishing that prior to the start of the tenancy there wa no detectable methamphetamine at the the landlord provided a further methamphetamine test carried out in which returned positive trace of methamphetamine ranging from g to g most of the area tested were at the level of g other than bedroom and based on that evidence i am satisfied that methamphetamine ha been consumed in the premise at some point during the tenancy the breach is not capable of remedy because it is serious and constitutes useof the premise for an unlawful purpose there is no evidence that methamphetamine ha been consumed by the tenant herself she wa shocked and upset at what wa found the tenant suggested however that she did find out afterwards that someone who had visited or stayed at the premise perhaps a family member may have done so without her knowledge or consent methamphetamine can last on surface for lengthy period of time there is no way to determine when methamphetamine wa consumed i can only be satisfied that it wa consumed at some point during the tenancy the tenant did not suggest that anyone wa in her premise without her permission based on that i must infer that whoever ha smoked methamphetamine wa at the premise with her permission that unfortunately mean she is liable for their act even though she may not have known what they were doing i therefore find that the tenant ha committed an unlawful act the seriousness of the unlawful activity in question here is at the upper end of the scale and i am satisfied it would be inequitable to refuse to make an order terminating the tenancy i appreciate that the tenant s personal circumstance are such that moving out will be difficult however i can not consider the impact on the tenant in making an order for termination of the tenancy accordingly the landlord s application for termination of the tenancy is granted given my finding it is not necessary to address the other ground relied on by the landlord for termination should the order the tenant to pay exemplary damage damage are designed to punish and deter they are like a fine in nzlr stated and punitive damage are different word for the same thing the damage are exemplary because they are meant to teach an example to the guilty officer and others they are punitive because they are meant to punish they are like a fine though they go to the citizen who ha been the victim of conduct exemplary damage are awarded at the s discretion when one party ha proved that the other party ha committed a defined unlawful act the must consider whether it would be just to do so having regard to the party s intent the effect of the unlawful act the interest of the other party and the public interest see section intentional mean that the party who ha committed the breach must be aware of it the focus of the intention however must be the act or omission and not the legal knowledge of the offending party in this case the landlord submitted that whoever had smoked drug in the property must have been connected to the tenant in some way they therefore say there wa some element of knowledge on her part essentially the landlord is saying that the tenant must have known that person wa a drug user and so there wa a likelihood that drug were going to be consumed while they were at her property i accept that there may be some basis for such a suspicion on the landlord s part however a suspicion is not proof bearing in mind that the landlord carry the onus and burden of proof i am not persuaded that it is more likely than not that the tenant wa aware that methamphetamine had been smoked in her house i therefore find that the breach wa not intentional even if i had been persuaded that the breach wa intentional i do not consider it would have been just to award exemplary damage in this case that is because exemplary damage are meant to punish a guilty party and it is difficult to see how the tenant s conduct could be characterised in this way the claim for exemplary damage is therefore dismissed j setefano
