floor in part of the both party attended the hearing mr and represented the landlord the tenant ha applied for a full refund of rent a compensation for the loss of enjoyment and use of the premise due to dampness and moisture that compromised area of flooring and caused mould in the living room the tenant also alleges that there wa no source of heating at the background the tenancy started on it wa a fixed term tenancy to during the tenancy various repair issue arose the main issue wa dampness that affected the floor in the bathroom shower toilet and adjoining bedroom the tenant say there wa no source of heating and in the premise were cold the tenant contacted government agency for assistance the were placed in emergency accommodation and they had to move several time before being offered a house where they now reside when the landlord had the dampness issue assessed a leaking pipe under wa discovered that wa the cause of the dampness in the floor in the affected room the floor were sealed plywood contractor unavailability meant that the leak could not be repaired immediately the landlord offered the tenant other place to view but the tenant did not consider them within his rental price range the tenancy ended on the landlord agreed to release the tenant from the fixed term tenancy on the tenant made the application that is before the he sought compensation in the form of a full refund of rent paid for what he alleged wa the landlord s failure to provide and maintain the premise in a reasonable state of repair the tenant did not attend the first scheduled hearing the application wa dismissed however the adjudicator who wa to hear the application granted the tenant a rehearing issue the issue before the are these did the landlord fail to provide and maintain the premise in a reasonable state of repair if so should the award the tenant compensation did the landlord fail to provide and maintain the premise in a reasonable state of repair the tenant alleges that the premise had no form of heating the landlord produced evidence pre and post tenancy inspection report that show there wa a heat pump in the lounge when i put that to the tenant he said the unit wa an air conditioner a heat pump ha distinct function heating and cooling i suspect that the tenant did not know that the unit wa a heat pump a well a an air conditioner i find that the premise did have a source of heating the previously existing fireplace having been blocked up a required by there wa no breach by the landlord failing to provide a source of heating therefore the fact that the tenant chose to sleep in their car with the heating on during the coldest night wa not a consequence of any landlord breach nor is the presence of a small area of mould in the living room in front of the closed off fireplace the landlord accepted that there wa a leaking pipe under the floor of the premise that affected the plywood flooring in the bathroom shower toilet and adjacent bedroom the tenant said that all the floor in the premise were affected but there is insufficient evidence for me to find that wa the case due to contractor unavailability the landlord could not have the leaking pipe repaired and the leaking continued for at least of the tenancy while the leaking wa probably present before then the landlord did not have it assessed the tenant said he told his then property manager about the dampness issue in the bathroom and wa promised it would be repaired he said no one came to fix it the landlord produced evidence that it contractor found it difficult to contact the tenant the landlord said they were first advised about the leaking on and the contractor assessed the problem on and regardless of the conflict in the evidence it is clear that there wa a leaking issue that made the plywood flooring damp and spongy something that needed to be repaired but wa not this affected the tenant s enjoyment of the tenancy the tenant also claimed that the kitchen tap wa faulty and would not turn off the landlord said they were informed of the tap issue in and the repair wa done on evidence of the repair the invoice wa produced in evidence the tap were replaced overall the pre and post inspection report including photo do not show that the premise were in the state of disrepair alleged by the tenant however i accept that there would have been some loss of enjoyment of the tenancy due to the dampness that resulted from the leaking pipe under and this restricted the use of part of the had the tenant realised that there wa a heat pump at the premise not just an air conditioner some of that loss of enjoyment would have been reduced should the award the tenant compensation the may award compensation to a tenant for loss arising from a proven breach or breach by the landlord of their statutory responsibility compensation is generally awarded for actual loss and sometimes for le tangible effect of proven breach such a a loss of enjoyment of the tenancy and the accompanying stress and anxiety the tenant s compensation claim is for the loss of use of and therefore enjoyment of the tenancy in nzdc the confirmed that the must consider the following factor when deciding to award compensation the nature of the breach the duration of the breach and the effect of the breach on the party the tenant seek a full refund of rent that claim is unrealistic rent can only abate when the premise are destroyed or so seriously damaged in whole or in part so a to become uninhabitable that wa not the case here the tenant can not be compensated for his belief that there wa no heat pump the evidence show that there wa a heat pump the landlord committed no breach the tenant did experience a loss of enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness that affected the flooring in the bathroom shower toilet and adjacent bedroom that loss of enjoyment wa not due to a landlord breach a such it wa due to a burst pipe but the repair work could not be done quickly and it is probable that the problem wa present from early on in the tenancy compensation is not punitive it simply recognises that the tenant ha suffered a loss of enjoyment in this case due to a necessary repair issue that wa delayed the landlord agreed to release the tenant from the fixed term tenancy but that too cause disruption and stress for a tenant rental property are in demand especially in the price range the tenant could afford so the landlord s offer doe not detract from the loss of enjoyment the tenant experienced for this loss of enjoyment i award the tenant compensation of reflecting the principle set out in mentioned above the landlord will pay the tenant compensation of for his loss of enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness issue and the delayed repair of the burst pipe that caused the dampness i make no order reimbursing the filing fee the tenant s application is only marginally successful name suppression both party sought a name suppression order i make no order for name suppression the tenant s application is only successful in small part the landlord ha not fully defended the application an order having been made against it
