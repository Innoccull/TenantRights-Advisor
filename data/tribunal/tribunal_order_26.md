nztt event location suppressed applicant the applicant s respondent tenancy address tenancy address suppressed an application for suppression ha been made in this case and the order suppression of the name and identifying detail by way of declaration the landlord is entitled to show the premise to prospective tenant at any reasonable time after giving the tenant hour notice must pay the landlord the filing fee of immediately the application by the tenant for a declaration and exemplary damage is dismissed of the tenant and the landlord attended the hearing the tenant seek a declaration that the landlord is unable to hold viewing for the premise for prospective tenant and exemplary damage for breach of quiet enjoyment the landlord ha cross applied for a declaration allowing viewing for prospective tenant the tenancy is for a fixed term from to at rent per week ha the landlord breached the tenant quiet enjoyment the tenant claim the landlord ha breached their quiet enjoyment of the premise by showing prospective tenant around the property without consent on the tenant submitted that since they had made it clear to the previous landlord that the property wa not available for viewing by prospective tenant because they had not made up their mind whether they would be staying in the premise after the end of the fixed term further the tenant said they were advised via email on that the landlord would be showing family member around the premise with a view to them becoming tenant in based on the fact that the landlord undertook the viewing after the email and the difficulty which had arisen with repair and maintenance during the tenancy the tenant believed the landlord had committed an unlawful act and wanted exemplary damage in response the landlord submitted that because she did not receive any response to her email of she believed she had the consent of the tenant for the viewing further because the tenant who were at the premise on did not object to the viewing the landlord went ahead with showing the premise to her son a landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace comfort or privacy of the tenant in their use of the see section residential tenancy act breaching this obligation in circumstance that amount to harassment is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section and a rta i find the landlord ha not breached the tenant quiet enjoyment in their use of the premise by showing prospective tenant the premise and certainly not in circumstance that amount to harassment this is a fixed term tenancy it is one to which section a a amended in applies the effect of section a is to continue a fixed term tenancy a a periodic tenancy unless any of the circumstance specified in section a or applies the amendment only applies to tenancy granted after this is the case here a the tenancy began on subsection a provides that the tenancy doe not continue a a periodic tenancy if a before the expiry the party renew or extend the existing tenancy agreement or b before the expiry the party agree not to continue with the tenancy or c at least day before the expiry the tenant give the landlord written notice of the tenant s intention not to continue with the tenancy or d before the expiry a party give notice in relation to physical assault unlawful residential premise mortgagee entitled to possession destruction of premise where a breach render premise uninhabitable and maximum level of contaminant none which are applicable in this case although the tenant have not yet given the landlord any notice about whether they are continuing with the tenancy and have until to do so this doe not mean that the landlord can not show prospective tenant the under section a landlord and tenant have right about how a fixed term tenancy may end the renting of premise is a business and the landlord suggested because of the size of the property finding new tenant could be difficult a had happened at the beginning of i consider the evidence support that the landlord is attempting to ensure the continuation of her business a far a the legislation allows her to do so however the landlord need to be careful of signing up any new tenancy agreement for when there is an existing tenancy still in place be that fixed term or periodic harassment mean to trouble worry or distress or to wear out tire or exhaust and indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person v dodds civ black s law dictionary defines harassment a word conduct or action usu repeated or persistent that being directed at a specific person annoys alarm or cause substantial emotional distress in that person and serf no legitimate purpose these definition suggest there must be evidence of some ongoing intentional action directed at a specific person which cause distress to them therefore a single act of interference with the tenant s quiet enjoyment would be unlikely to amount to harassment unless it wa an occasion of significant seriousness which i do not consider is the case here a the landlord ha not committed an unlawful act the claim for exemplary damage fails did the landlord enter without consent and did the tenant unreasonably withhold consent the landlord s claim the tenant ha not allowed her entry to the premise when she wa entitled to enter after the viewing on the landlord submitted that she received an email from the tenant suggesting that she had entered the premise without consent and they did not agree to the premise being shown to prospective tenant the landlord said she sent a notice to the tenant dated advising them she believed their refusal to allow viewing wa a breach on the other hand the tenant believed it wa unreasonable for the landlord to schedule viewing because they had not told the landlord whether or not they were leaving the tenancy at the end of the fixed term a landlord may enter the premise during the tenancy at any reasonable time with the tenant s consent for the purpose of showing the premise to among others prospective tenant see section a residential tenancy act under subsection a a tenant may not withhold consent unreasonably and a landlord may not enter without prior consent breaching these respective obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section and a residential tenancy act for the reason set out in paragraph and i find the tenant have committed an unlawful act by unreasonably refusing to allow viewing of the premise by prospective tenant the reason given by the tenant that there should be no viewing because they have nt yet told the landlord whether they are leaving is i consider not a reasonable excuse the landlord ha indicated that the prospective tenant she ha in mind who are the friend of her son need to be shown through within before the end of the university year based on the evidence of the landlord i do not consider this is unreasonable a the landlord did not ask for exemplary damage for the breach by the tenant i do not need to consider that issue i find the landlord did have consent to enter the premise on when the tenant received the hour notice about the viewing they did not respond to the landlord the evidence of the landlord support that the tenant at the premise at the time of the viewing did not object and this evidence wa not disputed by the tenant i have ordered by way of declaration that the landlord is entitled to show prospective tenant the premise pursuant to section a the tenant application for a declaration fails a the applicant s ha wholly succeeded with the claim i must award the filing fee suppression is granted to the landlord pursuant to section a because she wa successful with the claim no filing fee or suppression is available to the tenant j wilson
