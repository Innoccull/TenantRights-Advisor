pump dishwasher and flooring in the kitchen lounge the witness also explained his invoice and suggested that all the work undertaken on the premise wa not charged for in particular the damage to the external wall in i am persuaded by the evidence provided including the witness and photograph that significant damage wa caused to the premise during the tenancy this included hole in wall and door the heat pump removed from the wall the dishwasher wa damaged and flooring in the kitchen lounge had to be replaced the damage is more than fair wear and tear although the tenant did not dispute most of the damage they were unhappy with the amount being claimed in making an award i have taken into account betterment and depreciation the landlord should be returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached their obligation and should not be better or worse off in calculating depreciation i have considered the age and condition of the item at the start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan and the acknowledgement of both the landlord and witness that the premise had been remedied to a higher standard using more industrial material than previously a limited a agent for t barnes ha wholly succeeded with the claim i must award the filing fee j wilson
