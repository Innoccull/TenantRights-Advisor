that an average expected lifespan of a hob is mr submitted that the fact that this hob needed to be replaced after show that mr treated it carelessly either leaving wet item on the element or failing to clean up spill mr chaudry s claim seek cleaning cost and the cost of purchasing and installing a new hob mr submitted that a the hob element were already showing sign of deterioration at the beginning of the tenancy mr provided a photograph in support of thisb the hob is a bellini brand that can be purchased at for these hob have a short lifespan and are particularly susceptible to rusting element in support of this mr provided i an email from a service manager with who state it is common for this style of hob to rust after only a short time these cheaper cooktops are more suited to a holiday home beach house etc that is only used a few time a year the more expensive brand are made using better steel in the hotplate which should last a lot longer than their cheaper counterpart although hotplate do not last a long a a ceramic top or quality gas cooktop would ii star product review of the bellini hob from the website reviewer succinctly describes the product a rubbish and state this product is not fit for purpose element rusted on first use the stainless steel is so thin it get very hot to touch and spill bake on and can not be cleaned the other star review also note that the element rusted quickly and extensively i note that there are now a total of rating of this product on the website star star and of the star review also state rust very quickly the evidence provided by mr is sufficient to rebut the inference that the rapid deterioration of the element is due to some careless action by mr henwood rather than normal wear and tear for this particular make and model this part of the landlord s claim is dismissed key at the end of the tenancy mr wa missing key he had a conversation with mr about this mr said that he would look for the key mr said that wa fine and if mr could not find them then he would simply cut more key mr found key but not the other the claim seek the cost of cutting a new key plus the landlord s time and travel mr submitted that the landlord ha insurance for replacement of key or lock with a nil excess a tenant s liability for careless damage to the property is limited to the amount of the landlord s insurance excess or the equivalent of rent whichever is the lesser mr s argument is that this principle also applies to his liability for replacing the missing key my finding is that the limitation doe not apply the section in the residential tenancy act that set out the limitation is within a part of the act entitled responsibility for damage that part includes section e per section the limitation applies to the tenant s liability for destruction of or damage to the premise that is caused by a careless act or omission of the tenant the tenant s obligation to return all key at the end of the tenancy is in a different part of the act a tenant s failure to return the key doe not amount to destruction of or damage to the the limitation of liability doe not apply even though hold insurance with a nil excess he is not obliged to make an insurance claim mr is liable for the proven and reasonable cost of replacing the key the amount claimed by mr is fair and reasonable mr is entitled to be compensated for his time in addition to the actual cost of cutting a new key cleaning must leave the premise reasonably clean and tidy at the end of the tenancy the claim seek representing half an hour of cleaning to sweep out the carport and to remove a few pile of dirt dust that the tenant had left in the garage overall the premise were left in a reasonably clean and tidy condition but mr choudry s photograph show that these area were overlooked and the claim is fair and reasonable power turned off at the end of the tenancy mr had the power disconnected on of the tenancy and re connected to his new property when mr choudry attempted to get power re established via his own power company he wa not able to do so after several frustrating phone call over a period of mr choudry discovered that the main power switch at the property had been switched off mr seek compensation for his time and inconvenience mr submitted that it is normal to switch off the main power when leaving a property in this instance he did not switch off the power it wa most likely done by of his friend who were helping him move out mr submitted that the power went off around midday which is when he asked his power company to disconnect the power he wa not aware that one of his helper had turned off the main switch i acknowledge that mr did incur inconvenience and delay because of this issue however mr ha not done anything that amount to a breach of his legal duty a a tenant there is no legal basis to hold mr liable for this cost and this part of the landlord s application must be dismissed compensation for general inconvenience the claim seek compensation for time and inconvenience relating to the tenant not doing their duty per the tenancy contract and leaving the mess for the landlord to sort including filing this application and writing all this explanation even dealing with multiple text abusive message and blackmail attempt this part of mr choudry s application is dismissed for the following reason a ha no power to award cost to any party except in certain limited circumstance none of which apply in this instance b the proven claim against mr is very minor with a tenant and dealing with end of tenancy issue is part of a landlord s normal business and the landlord can not have any reasonable expectation of being compensated for that activity above and beyond the rent mr gave mr notice to terminate the tenancy on the ground that he wa going to put the property on the market for sale mr submitted that he had a conversation with mr sometime after mr choudry gave notice and in that conversation mr said that he intended to put a single tenant into the property and then sell the property with that person a a sitting tenant mr submitted that this a render the termination unlawful and invalid and b amount to discrimination on the basis of family status which is a prohibited ground of discrimination under the human right act mr noted that a at the date of hearing mr choudry had not put the house on the market for sale mr did not in fact rent the property to a single tenant after mr vacated had he done so it is arguable whether this action would have made the termination unlawful the intent and purpose of permitting the landlord to terminate a tenancy if they intend to sell the premise is to allow the landlord to market the property when it is unoccupied and to sell it with vacant possession from that perspective allowing the landlord to re rent the premise after terminating a tenancy on the basis of putting the property on the market for sale seems contrary to the spirit and intent of this provision however it is not contrary to the actual word of the section section a rta state that a landlord may terminate a periodic tenancy by notice if the premise are to be put on the market for sale within of the end of the tenancy there is no specific requirement that the property remain untenanted after the termination until the sale mr s argument that mr choudry s proposed action would amount to discrimination on the basis of family status is tenable discrimination is an unlawful act under section of the residential tenancy act and exemplary damage of can apply given that mr did not replace with a single tenant there is no basis for me to consider an award of exemplary damage in this instance a noted above part of the requirement for termination under section a is that the landlord put the property on the market within of the termination of the tenancy that ha not happened in this instance mr submitted that after mr vacated he discovered that part of the property required repair and maintenance he discussed with his real estate agent whether he would be better to carry out the repair and then market the house or sell it a is after some consideration he decided to carry out the repair this ha delayed the house going onto the market i accept that when mr choudry gave the notice he intended to put the property on the market within of the end of the tenancy i accept that mr choudry still intends to sell the property and the delay is due to information that only came to light at the end of the tenancy i am satisfied that the termination wa lawful outcome both party will bear their own cost of the filing fee mr will receive from the bond the balance of the bond will be released to mr
