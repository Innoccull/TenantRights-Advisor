In a text message to the tenant, a landlord said “we don’t want to enter into a legal tenancy because of the toilet issue etc”, but “we will allow you to use the house in exchange for maintenance, at this stage and can we review it in 6 months say, ok?”.

The Tribunal said that there was a legal tenancy and that the Residential Tenancies Act applied. It found that the agreement was not clear enough to be a 6-month fixed-term tenancy, so it was deemed to be periodic.
