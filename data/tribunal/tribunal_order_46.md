A tenant moved into a property. She felt she had made it clear to the landlord that she needed the property until at least Christmas, so believed she had a secure arrangement for this period. There was no written tenancy agreement.

Part way through this period the landlord gave the tenant 90 days’ notice terminating the tenancy. The landlord disagreed that the tenancy was for a fixed-term and said she understood that the tenant wanted the property for a short (but undefined) period and that she had no intention of entering into a fixed-term tenancy.

The Tribunal found that the tenant had not proven that the tenancy was for a fixed term. By consequence it was considered a periodic tenancy and the landlord’s 90-day notice ending the tenancy was valid.
