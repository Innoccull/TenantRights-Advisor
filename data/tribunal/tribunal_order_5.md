after work to check the basement after the rain next time i will definitely inform you nick the tenant tell me that having the landlord at the premise wa stressful and unsettling i accept that the landlord wa apologetic about coming to the property without notice and wa doing so a he thought it wa an emergency but he should have been careful to tell the tenant that he wa coming to the property and the purpose of his visit before he did so it is in the public interest that when a landlord breach this obligation that an award of exemplary damage is made and taking into account all of the factor outlined above i consider a modest award of to be the appropriate award of damage for this act did the landlord breach the tenant s quiet enjoyment a landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace comfort or privacy of the tenant in their use of the see section residential tenancy act breaching this obligation in circumstance that amount to harassment is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section and a rta harassment mean to trouble worry or distress or to wear out tire or exhaust and indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person v dodds civ the tenant claim that the landlord s frequent entry to the basement wa a breach of quiet enjoyment whilst i agree that the landlord s entering the premise in breach of s is also a breach of the tenant s quiet enjoyment the court have made it clear that the same act can not be sanctioned twice in other word that i can not award lot of damage for the same event manage my rental limited v baxter nzdc i do not think it right to further censure the landlord by way of exemplary damage for the fact that those failure also resulted in an unlawful act under a different provision therefore the tenant s claim for breach of quiet enjoyment in respect of the unlawful entry on is dismissed the tenant have claimed that there were many occasion that the landlord came to the property unannounced the tenant ha not given date or specific for those other occasion apart from a mentioned there wa a serious issue with ponding in the basement that the landlord wa trying to remedy he tell me that he enjoyed a good relationship with the tenant until he put the house on the market and he would call around after rain to check if the basement had leaked he said he usually texted or called the tenant beforehand he thought that the tenant wa happy with him doing this until he received the tenant s text of november having heard the evidence and submission of both party i am satisfied that the landlord did not go the property for any other purpose but to check for leak and that apart from the unlawful entry on he did not enter the property without first giving notice after the tenant had sent her text of the the tenant also claim that the landlord breached the tenant s quiet enjoyment on by the manner in which the landlord spoke to the tenant and the text message between the tenant and landlord having heard the evidence from both party it appears that the tenant thought that the landlord wa accusing her of flooding the basement i disagree with that interpretation the landlord tell me that he wa voicing his frustration to the tenant that he did not know what had caused the leak and that he thought he had resolved the water problem i do not consider the tone of the written correspondence to be that of harassment and i do not think that it wa the landlord s intention that the text or conversation on be to trouble worry and distress the tenant i am not satisfied that the interaction with redacted wa a breach of the tenant s quiet enjoyment the landlord had never met redacted before and he wa quite correct to say he wanted to speak to the tenant not to redacted a he did not know if redacted wa talking to him on behalf of the tenant or not the tenant s claim for breach of quiet enjoyment are dismissed wa the notice given on retaliatory on the landlord gave the tenant a notice ending the tenancy on the tenant claim the notice is retaliatory for a notice to be declared retaliatory the tenant must prove that in terminating the tenancy the landlord wa motivated wholly or partly by the tenant exercising a right under the tenancy agreement or any act or by any complaint against the landlord see section
