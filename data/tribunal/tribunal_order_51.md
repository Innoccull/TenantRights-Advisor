The landlord claimed the tenant owed $2,250 in rent. The landlord would collect the rent in cash and then spend it on groceries, rather than banking it, so there were no bank records. The landlord kept a rent book, but many entries had no dates next to them and were not signed.

The Tenancy Tribunal found that the landlord’s rent records were unreliable and that there was not adequate proof of rent arrears. They dismissed the landlord’s claim. The Tribunal also required the landlord to pay $200 in exemplary damages for failing to provide rent receipts. 

They said a landlord must keep proper business records showing all payments of rent and bond by the tenant. The Tribunal noted that proper business records are records that are orderly, to a high standard, completed when the payment is made, and that marks on a calendar or a scrap of paper are not good enough.
