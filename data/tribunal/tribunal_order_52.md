Nadia usually pays $300 a week in rent. She has recently lost her job and for the last two weeks she has missed her payment. The landlord has left a message on her phone asking for the money to be paid immediately.

Nadia wants to get on top of the rent payments but canâ€™t afford to pay it all at once. Because she owns assets over the threshold, Nadia is not eligible for the Rent Arrears Assistance payment from Work and Income. She has now got some part time work and, after putting together a budget, she thinks she can manage repayments of $50 a week.

Nadia owes her landlord $600, which if repaid at $50 a week will take her 12 weeks to pay off ($600 / $50 = 12 weeks). So, for the next 12 weeks Nadia will need to pay $50 a week on top of keeping up with ongoing rent payments, ie, $350 per week for the next 12 weeks.
