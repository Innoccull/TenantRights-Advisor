A landlord in Northland lived in a portable cabin next to the rented house. The tenant told the Tenancy Tribunal that the landlord harassed her and her family. This included shouting at her visitors, posting bizarre messages on social media about her, banging on the windows early in the morning and shouting at the tenant and her children to get up, and turning off the electricity to the house. The landlord also installed an outdoor shower at the house, then would use it herself.
 
The Tribunal found that these actions were a serious breach of the tenantâ€™s quiet enjoyment, and amounted to harassment. The Tribunal ordered the landlord to pay the tenant exemplary damages of $1,500 for the harassment.

Tenancy Tribunal Order 4158660 paras [22] - [27].
