Tenants were found liable for damage done by their dogs urinating on the carpet of their rental property. The High Court said that because the dogs had already urinated on the carpet in the past, and the tenants would have known they would do this again because they roamed around freely inside the house.

Although the tenancy agreement expressly permitted dogs on the property, the Court said that did not mean the landlord assumed all risks of damage. The tenants had also told the landlord that the dogs were house-trained. The damage was deemed to be intentional.
