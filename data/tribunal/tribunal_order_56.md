A tenant rented a cottage in a rural area for 13 years. Over that time, the landlord never conducted a formal inspection, although they undertook some repairs when the tenant asked.

The cottage gradually got so rundown that there was extensive mould, rotting window joinery and weatherboards (causing draughts and damp, and allowing rats to get in), no insulation, blocked guttering and no filters to the house’s tank water system. The landlord also failed to install working smoke alarms.

Even though the tenant hadn’t complained during the tenancy, the Tribunal awarded her almost $11,000 by way of compensation and rent reduction for the landlord’s failure to maintain the house.

Tenancy Tribunal Order 4269743.
