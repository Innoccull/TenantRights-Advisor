Tenants were ordered to cover the cost of damage to the carpet and wall on the basis that this was intentional. During the tenancy the lounge carpet was heavily stained and had to be replaced and there was impact damage to a wall.

The Tenancy Tribunal found that “even if the act that initiated the staining to the carpet was accidental, the permanent staining was likely the result of the tenant’s failure to clean the carpet promptly after the incident which makes the cause of the staining intentional”.
