In Tenancy Tribunal Order 4212382, the adjudicator described how:

"Usually the party applying for the rehearing must show that something went wrong with the Tribunalâ€™s procedure," and that

"A rehearing may also be granted where there is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the first hearing, if it could have affected the outcome."

"The District Court has held that if the Tribunal was simply wrong in its findings of fact, or its application of the law, this is not sufficient to establish a miscarriage of justice: a rehearing is not an alternative to an appeal."
